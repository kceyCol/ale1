FOREWORD
To the 1st Edition
It is with the greatest enthusiasm that I introduce Pocket Medicine. In an
era of information glut, it will logically be asked,“Why another manual
for medical house officers?” Yet, despite enormous information readily
available in any number of textbooks, or at the push of a key on a com-
puter, it is often that the harried house officer is less helped by the
description of differential diagnosis and therapies than one would wish.
Pocket Medicine is the joint venture between house staff and faculty
expert in a number of medical specialties.This collaboration is designed
to provide a rapid but thoughtful initial approach to medical problems
seen by house officers with great frequency. Questions that frequently
come from faculty to the house staff on rounds, many hours after the
initial interaction between patient and doctor, have been anticipated and
important pathways for arriving at diagnoses and initiating therapies are
presented.This approach will facilitate the evidence-based medicine dis-
cussion that will follow the workup of the patient.This well-conceived
handbook should enhance the ability of every medical house officer to
properly evaluate a patient in a timely fashion and to be stimulated to
think of the evidence supporting the diagnosis and the likely outcome of
therapeutic intervention. Pocket Medicine will prove to be a worthy addi-
tion to medical education and to the care of our patients.

PREFACE
For Jenny, Matteo, and Natalie with love
Written by residents, fellows, and attendings, the mandate for Pocket
Medicine was to provide,in a concise a manner as possible,the key infor-
mation a clinician needs for the initial approach to and management of
the most common inpatient medical problems.
The tremendous response to the previous editions suggests we
were able to help fill an important need for clinicians.With this fourth
edition come several major improvements including: a thorough updat-
ing of every topic; the addition of several new topics (including acute
aortic syndromes, sepsis, obstructive sleep apnea, hepatic vascular dis-
ease, optimal use of diuretics, viral respiratory infections, infections in
susceptible hosts, intensive glycemic control, approach to the patient
with joint pain, and alcohol withdrawal); incorporation of references to
the most recent reviews and important studies published through the
middle of 2010; and the addition of high-resolution chest radiographs,
chest and abdominal CTs, and echocardiograms, and photomicrographs
of peripheral blood smears and urinalyses.We welcome any suggestions
for further improvement.
Of course medicine is far too vast a field to ever summarize in a
textbook of any size. Long monographs have been devoted to many of
the topics discussed herein. Pocket Medicine is meant only as a starting
point to guide one during the initial phases of diagnosis and management
until one has time to consult more definitive resources. Although the
recommendations herein are as evidence-based as possible, medicine is
both a science and an art.As always, sound clinical judgement must be
applied to every scenario.
I am grateful for the support of the house officers, fellows, and
attendings at the Massachusetts General Hospital.It is a privilege to work
with such a knowledgeable,dedicated,and compassionate group of physi-
cians. I always look back on my time there as Chief Resident as one of
the best experiences I have ever had. I am grateful to several outstanding
clinical mentors, including Hasan Bazari, Denny Ausiello, Larry Friedman,
Nesli Basgoz, Mort Swartz, Eric Isselbacher, Bill Dec, Mike Fifer, and
Roman DeSanctis, as well as the late Charlie McCabe and Peter Yurchak.
Special thanks to my parents for their perpetual encouragement and love
and, of course, to my wife, Jennifer Tseng, who, despite being a surgeon, is
my closest advisor, my best friend, and the love of my life.
I hope that you find Pocket Medicine useful throughout the arduous
but incredibly rewarding journey of practicing medicine.

Initial approach
• Focused history: quality & severity of pain; location & radiation; provoking & palliating 
factors; duration, frequency & pattern; setting in which it occurred; associated sx
• Targeted exam: VS (including BP in both arms), cardiac gallops, murmurs, or rubs;
signs of vascular disease (carotid or femoral bruits, T pulses), signs of heart failure;
lung & abdominal exam; chest wall exam for reproducibility of pain
• 12-lead ECG: obtain w/in 10 min; c/w priors & obtain serial ECGs; consider posterior
leads (V7–V9) to reveal isolated posterior MI if hx c/w ACS but ECG unrevealing
• Cardiac biomarkers (Tn, CK-MB): serial testing at presentation, 6–12 h after sx onset
troponin (I/T): most Se & Sp marker; level 99th %ile in approp. clinical setting is dx of MI
detectable 3–6 h after injury, peaks 24 h, may remain elevated for 7–10 d in STEMI
high-sens. assays: 90–95% Se & Sp; 85% Se w/in 3 h of sx onset (NEJM 2009;361:858, 868)
“false ” (non-ACS myonecrosis): myocarditis/toxic CMP, severe CHF, HTN crisis, PE
or severe resp. distress, cardiac trauma/cardioversion, sepsis, SAH, demand ischemia;
? renal failure (T clearance, skeletal myopathy vs. true microinfarctions)
CK-MB: less Se & Sp (skel. muscle, tongue, diaphragm, intestine, uterus, prostate)
• CXR; other imaging (echo, PE CTA, etc.) as indicated based on H&P and initial testing
• Coronary CT angiography: 1⁄2 free of CAD S 0% w/ ACS; 1⁄2 w/ plaque S 17% w/ ACS;
even with signif stenosis, only 35% w/ ACS (JACC 2009;53:1642). ∴good for r/o not r/i.

Exercise tolerance test (stress test) (NEJM 2001;344:1840)
• Indications: dx CAD, evaluate if known CAD &  in clinical status, risk stratify s/p
ACS, evaluate exercise tolerance, localize ischemia (imaging required)
• Contraindications
Absolute: AMI w/in 48 h, high-risk UA, acute PE, severe AS, uncontrolled CHF,
uncontrolled arrhythmias, myopericarditis, acute aortic dissection
Relative: left main CAD, mod valvular stenosis, severe HTN, HCMP, high-degree
AVB, severe electrolyte abnl, inability to exercise
• Exercise: standard Bruce (c speed/incline q3min), modified Bruce (begins w/o tread-
mill incline), submax (if 3 wk post-MI), or sx-limited; hold antianginals if trying to
dx CAD, give if assessing if Pt ischemic on meds
• Pharmacologic: if unable to exer., low exer. tol or recent MI. Se & Sp  exercise;
Preferred if LBBB. Requires imaging since ECG not specific in this setting. Coronary
vasodilators (will reveal CAD, but not tell you if Pt ischemic): regadenoson, dipyri-
damole, or adenosine (may precipitate bradycardia and bronchospasm).
Chronotropes/inotropes (physiologic): dobutamine (may precipitate tachyarrhythmias).
• Imaging: used if uninterpretable ECG (paced, LBBB, resting STT 1 mm, dig., LVH,
WPW), after indeterminate ECG test, pharmacologic tests, or localization of ischemia
SPECT (eg, 99mTc-sestamibi), PET (rubidium-82; usually w/ pharm test), echo, MRI
Test results
• HR (must achieve 85% of max predicted HR [220-age] for exercise test to be dx), BP
response, peak double product (HR  BP), HR recovery (HRpeak– HR1 min later; nl 12)
• Max exercise capacity achieved (METS or min)
• Occurrence of symptoms (at what level of exertion and similarity to presenting sx)
• ECG changes: downsloping or horizontal ST T (1 mm) predictive of CAD (but dis-
tribution of ST T do not localize ischemic territory); STE highly predictive
• Duke treadmill score  exercise min – (5  max ST dev) – (4  angina index) [0 none, 1
nonlimiting, 2 limiting]; score 5 S 1% 1-y mort; –10 to 4 S 2–3%;  –11 S 5%
• Imaging: radionuclide defects or echocardiographic regional wall motion abnormalities
reversible defect  ischemia; fixed defect  infarct
false : breast S ant “defect” and diaphragm S inf “defect”
false  may be seen if balanced (eg, 3VD) ischemia (global T perfusion w/o regional s)
ECG-gating allows assessment of LV systolic function
High-risk test results (PPV 50% for LM or 3VD, ∴consider coronary angiography)
• ECG: ST T 2 mm or 1 mm in stage 1 or in 5 leads or 5 min in recovery; ST c; VT
• Physiologic: T BP, exercise 4 METS, angina during exercise, Duke score  –11; EF 35%
• Radionuclide: 1 lg or 2 mod. reversible defects, transient LV cavity dilation, c lung uptake
Myocardial viability
• Goal: identify hibernating myocardium that could regain fxn after revascularization
• Options: MRI (Se 95%, Sp 70%), PET (Se 90%, Sp 75%), dobutamine stress
echo (Se 70%, Sp 85%); rest-redistribution thallium (Se 90%, Sp 55%)
CT & MR coronary angiography (NEJM 2008;369:2324; Circ 2010;121:2509)
• Image quality best at slower & regular HR (give B if possible, goal HR 55–60)
• Calcium generates artifact for CT angiography
• MRI being studied: angiography, perfusion, LV fxn, hyperenhancement (Circ 2009;119:1671)
Coronary artery calcium score (CACS, NEJM 2008;358:1336; JAMA 2010;303:1610)
• Quantitative evaluation of extent of calcium and thus estimate of plaque burden
• Not able to assess % stenosis of coronary arteries (no IV contrast)
• ? value in asx Pts w/ intermediate Framingham risk score (10–20% 10-y risk) w/ CACS of
0, 1–100, 101–300, and 300 corresponding to low, average, moderate, and high risk
• May be of value as screening text to r/o CAD in sx Pt (CACS 100 S 3% probability
of signif CAD; but high scores have poor specificity)

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY AND REVASCULARIZATION
Indications for coronary angiography in stable CAD or asx Pts
• CCS class III-IV angina despite medical Rx or angina  systolic dysfxn
• High-risk stress test findings (see prior topic)
• Uncertain dx after noninvasive testing (& compelling need to determine dx), occupational
need for definitive dx (eg, pilot), or inability to undergo noninvasive testing
• Systolic dysfxn with unexplained cause
• Survivor of SCD, polymorphic VT, sustained monomorphic VT
• Suspected spasm or nonatherosclerotic cause of ischemia (eg, anomalous coronary)
Pre-cath checklist
• Document peripheral arterial exam (femoral, DP, PT pulses; femoral bruits); NPO 6 h
• ✓CBC, PT, & Cr; give IVF (	 bicarb, acetylcysteine; see “CIAKI”); blood bank sample
• ASA 325 mg; consider clopidogrel preRx (300–600 mg 2–6 h before) vs. prasugrel
at time of PCI (if ACS)
Coronary revascularization in stable CAD (JACC 2004;44:e213 & 2006;47:e1)
• CABG: T mortality c/w med Rx (albeit pre statins & ACEI/ARB) in Pts w/ 3VD, LM,
or 2VD w/ critical prox LAD, and espec. if T EF (but viable myocardium); T repeat
revasc and trend toward T D/MI but c stroke c/w PCI in LM/3VD (NEJM 2009;360:961);
CABG vs. PCI being studied in DM (FREEDOM trial)
• PCI: T angina c/w med Rx; does not T D/MI (COURAGE, NEJM 2007;356:1503); prompt
revasc (PCI or CABG) did not T mortality vs. med Rx in DM (NEJM 2009;360:2503)
• PCI comparable to CABG in Pts w/o 3VD, w/o DM, and nl EF (Lancet 2009;373:1190)
• For stable CAD w/o critical anatomy and w/o T EF, initial focus on optimal med Rx
• If revasc deemed necessary, PCI if limited # of discrete lesions, nl EF, no DM, poor oper-
ative candidate; CABG if extensive or diffuse disease, T EF, DM, or valvular disease
• Fractional flow reserve [ratio of maximal flow (induced by IV or IC adenosine) distal vs.
proximal to a stenosis]: PCI only if 0.8 S T # stents & T D/MI/revasc (NEJM 2009;360:213)
PCI
• Balloon angioplasty (POBA): effective, but c/b dissection & elastic recoil & neointimal
hyperplasia S restenosis; now reserved for small lesions & ? some SVG lesions
• Bare metal stents (BMS): T elastic recoil S 33–50% T restenosis & repeat revasc (to 
10% by 12 mos) c/w POBA; requires ASA lifelong & clopidogrel  4 wks
• Drug-eluting stents (DES): T neointimal hyperplasia S 75% T restenosis, 50% T repeat
revasc (to 5% by 1 y), no c D/MI c/w BMS (NEJM 2008;359:1330); 2nd gen. everolimus DES
promising (NEJM 2010;362:1728); require ASA lifelong & clopidogrel  1 y (Circ 2007;115:813)
• Anticoagulant: UFH (short-acting, rapidly reversible, but need to ✓PTT/ACT), LMWH (no
need for monitoring, but t1/2 8–12 h), bivalirudin (T bleeding, but 	c MI; NEJM 2009;359:688)
Post-PCI complications
• Postprocedure ✓vascular access site, distal pulses, ECG, CBC, Cr, CK-MB
• Bleeding
hematoma/overt bleeding: manual compression, reverse/stop anticoag
retroperitoneal bleed: may present with T Hct 	 back pain; c HR & T BP late;
Dx: abd/pelvic CT (I–); Rx: reverse/stop anticoag, IVF/PRBC as required
if bleeding uncontrolled, consult performing interventionalist or surgery
• Vascular damage
pseudoaneurysm: triad of pain, expansile mass, systolic bruit; Dx: U/S; Rx: manual
compression, U/S-directed compression or thrombin injection, or surgical repair
AV fistula: continuous bruit; Dx: U/S; Rx: surgical repair
T perfusion to LE (embolization, dissection, thrombus): loss of distal pulse; Dx: angio;
Rx: percutaneous or surgical repair
• Peri-procedural MI: 3 ULN of CK-MB occurs in 5–10%; Qw MI in 1%
• Renal failure: contrast-induced manifests w/in 24 h, peaks 3–5 d (see “CIAKI”)
• Cholesterol emboli syndrome (typically in middle-aged & elderly and w/ Ao atheroma)
renal failure (late and progressive, eos in urine); mesenteric ischemia (abd pain,
LGIB, pancreatitis); intact distal pulses but livedo pattern and toe necrosis
• Stent thrombosis: mins to yrs after PCI, typically p/w AMI. Often due to mechanical
prob. (stent underexpansion or unrecognized dissection, typically presents early) or
d/c of antiplt Rx (espec if d/c both ASA & ADP blocker; JAMA 2005;293: 2126). Risk of
late stent thrombosis may be higher with DES than BMS (JACC 2006;48:2584).
• In-stent restenosis: mos after PCI, typically p/w gradual c angina (10% p/w ACS).
Due to combination of elastic recoil and neointimal hyperplasia; T w/ DES vs. BMS.

STEMI
Reperfusion
• Immediate reperfusion (ie, opening occluded culprit coronary artery) is critical
• In PCI-capable hospital, goal should be primary PCI w/in 90 min of 1st medical contact
• In non-PCI-capable hospital, consider transfer to PCI-capable hospital (see below), o/w
fibrinolytic therapy w/in 30 min of hospital presentation
• Do not let decision regarding method of reperfusion delay time to reperfusion
Primary PCI (NEJM 2007;356:47)
• Superior to lysis: 27% T death, 65% T reMI, 54% T stroke, 95% T ICH (Lancet 2003;361:13)
• Thrombus aspiration during angio prior to stenting T mortality (Lancet 2008;371:1915)
• Transfer to center for 1 PCI may also be superior to lysis (NEJM 2003;349:733), see below
Fibrinolysis vs. Hospital Transfer for Primary PCI
Assess Time and Risk
1. Time required for transport to skilled PCI lab: door-to-balloon 90 min &
[door-to-balloon]-[door-to-needle] 1 h favors transfer for PCI
2. Risk from STEMI: high-risk Pts (eg, shock) fare better with mechanical reperfusion
3. Time to presentation: efficacy of lytics T w/ c time from sx onset, espec. 3 h
4. Risk of fibrinolysis: if high risk of ICH or bleeding, PCI safer option
Adapted from ACC/AHA 2004 STEMI Guidelines (Circ 2004;110:e82)
Fibrinolysis
• Indications: sx 12 h and either STE 0.1 mV (1 mm) in 2 contig. leads or LBBB not
known to be old; benefit if sx 12 h less clear; reasonable if persistent sx & STE
• Mortality T 20% in anterior MI or LBBB and 10% in IMI c/w ∅reperfusion Rx
• Prehospital lysis (ie, ambulance): further 17% T in mortality (JAMA 2000;283:2686)
• 1% risk of ICH; high-risk groups include elderly (2% if 75 y), women, low wt
• Although age not contraindic., c risk of ICH in elderly (75 y) makes PCI more attractive

Nonprimary PCI
• Facilitated PCI: upstream lytic, GPI, or GPI  1⁄2 dose lytic before PCI of no benefit
• Rescue PCI if shock, unstable, failed reperfusion or persistent sx (NEJM 2005;353:2758)
• Routine angio 	 PCI w/in 24 h of successful lysis: T D/MI/Revasc (Lancet 2004;364:1045) and
w/in 6 h T reMI, recurrent ischemia & CHF c/w w/in 2 wk (NEJM 2009;360:2705);
∴if lysed at non-PCI capable hospital, consider transfer to PCI-capable hospital ASAP
espec if high-risk presentation (eg, anterior MI, inferior MI w/ low EF or RV infarct,
extensive STE or LBBB, HF, T BP or c HR)

Risk stratification
• Stress test if anatomy undefined or significant residual CAD after PCI of culprit vessel
• Echocardiogram to assess EF; EF c 6% in STEMI over 6 mos (JACC 2007;50:149)
Medications (barring contraindications)
• Aspirin: 162–325 mg/d for 1 mo (BMS) or 3–6 mos (DES); 75–162 mg/d thereafter
• ADP receptor blocker (eg, clopidogrel): 12 mos (? longer if DES); some PPIs may

evidence to date of impact on clinical outcomes (Lancet 2009;374:989; COGENT, TCT 2009) 
• -blocker: 23% T mortality after acute MI
• Statin: high-intensity lipid-lowering (eg, atorvastatin 80 mg, NEJM 2004;350:1495)

PAC
1-12
PA CATHETER AND TAILORED THERAPY 
Rationale
• Cardiac output (CO)  SV  HR; SV depends on LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)
∴manipulate LVEDV to optimize CO while minimizing pulmonary edema
• Balloon at tip of catheter inflated S floats into “wedge” position. Column of blood extends
from tip of catheter, through pulmonary circulation, to a point just proximal to LA. Under
conditions of no flow, PCWP  LA pressure  LVEDP, which is proportional to LVEDV.
• Situations in which these basic assumptions fail:
1) Catheter tip not in West lung zone 3 (and ∴PCWP  alveolar pressure Z LA
pressure); clues include lack of a & v waves and if PA diastolic pressure  PCWP
2) PCWP  LA pressure (eg, mediastinal fibrosis, pulmonary VOD, PV stenosis)
3) Mean LA pressure  LVEDP (eg, MR, MS)
4)  LVEDP-LVEDV relationship (ie, abnl compliance, ∴“nl” LVEDP may not be optimal)
Indications (JACC 1998;32:840 & Circ 2009;119:e391)
• Diagnosis and evaluation
Ddx of shock (cardiogenic vs. distributive; espec. if trial of IVF failed / high-risk) and
of pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs. not; espec. if trial of diuretic failed / high-risk)
Evaluation of CO, intracardiac shunt, pulmonary HTN, MR, tamponade
• Therapeutics
Tailored therapy to optimize PCWP, SV, SvO2 in heart failure/shock
Guide to vasodilator therapy (eg, inhaled NO, nifedipine) in pulmonary HTN
Guide to perioperative management in some high-risk Pts, pre-transplantation
• Contraindications
Absolute: right-sided endocarditis, thrombus, or mechanical R-sided valve
Relative: coagulopathy (reverse), recent PPM or ICD (place under fluoroscopy), LBBB
(5% risk of RBBB S CHB, place under fluoro), bioprosthetic R-sided valve
Efficacy concerns
• No benefit to routine PAC in high-risk surgery or ARDS (NEJM 2006;354:2213)
• No benefit in decompensated CHF (JAMA 2005;294:1625); untested in cardiogenic shock
• But: 1⁄2 of CO & PCWP clinical estimates incorrect; CVP & PCWP not well correl.; ∴use
PAC to (a) answer hemodynamic ? and then remove, or (b) manage cardiogenic shock
Placement
• Insertion site: R internal jugular or L subclavian veins for “anatomic” flotation into PA 
• Inflate balloon (max 1.5 mL) when advancing and to measure PCWP
• Use resistance to inflation and pressure tracing to avoid overinflation
• Deflate the balloon when withdrawing and at all other times
• CXR should be obtained after bedside placement to assess for catheter position and PTX
• If catheter cannot be successfully floated (typically if severe TR or RV dilatation) or if
another relative contraindication exists, consider fluoroscopic guidance
Complications
• Central venous access: pneumo/hemothorax (1–3%), arterial puncture, air embolism
• Advancement: atrial or ventricular arrhythmias (3% VT), RBBB (5%), catheter knot-
ting, cardiac perforation/tamponade, PA rupture
• Maintenance: infection (especially if catheter 3 d old), thrombus, pulmonary
infarction (1%), PA rupture/pseudoaneurysm (esp. w/ PHT), balloon rupture
Intracardiac pressures
• Transmural pressure ( preload)  measured intracardiac pressure-intrathoracic pressure
• Intrathoracic pressure (usually slightly ) is transmitted to vessels and heart
• Always measure intracardiac pressure at end-expiration, when intrathoracic pressure
closest to 0; (“high point” in spont. breathing Pts;“low point” in Pts on  pressure vent.)
• If c intrathoracic pressure (eg, PEEP), measured PCWP overestimates true transmural
pressures. Can approx by subtracting 1⁄2 PEEP (convert cmH2O to mmHg by  3⁄4).
• PCWP: LV preload best estimated at a wave; risk of pulmonary edema from avg PCWP 
Cardiac output
• Thermodilution: saline injected in RA.  in temp over time measured at thermis-
tor (in PA) is integrated  1/CO. Inaccurate if T CO, sev TR, or shunt.
• Fick method: O2 consumption (L/min)  CO (L/min)  arteriovenous O2 difference.
CO derived by dividing O2 consumption by observed AV O2 difference [10  1.34 ml
O2/g Hb  Hb g/dl  (SaO2 – SvO2)].
Can estimate O2 consumption using wt-based formula, but best to measure (espec
if c metabolism, eg, sepsis).
If SVO2 80%, consider wedged (ie, pulm vein) sat, LSR shunt, impaired O2 utiliza-
tion (severe sepsis, cyanide, carbon monoxide), cc O2 delivery.

HEART FAILURE
Definitions (Braunwald’s Heart Disease, 8th ed., 2008)
• Failure of heart to pump blood forward at sufficient rate to meet metabolic demands of
peripheral tissues, or ability to do so only at abnormally high cardiac filling pressures
• Low output (T cardiac output) vs. high output (c stroke volume 	 c cardiac output)
• Left-sided (pulmonary edema) vs. right-sided (c JVP, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema)
• Backward (c filling pressures, congestion) vs. forward (impaired systemic perfusion)
• Systolic (inability to expel sufficient blood) vs. diastolic (failure to relax and fill normally)
Figure 1-3 Approach to left-sided heart failure
History
• Low output: fatigue, weakness, exercise intolerance,  MS, anorexia
• Congestive: left-sided S dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
right-sided S peripheral edema, RUQ discomfort, bloating, satiety
Functional classification (New York Heart Association class)
• Class I: no sx w/ ordinary activity; class II: sx w/ ordinary activity;
Class III: sx w/ minimal activity; class IV: sx at rest

but only 50% of severe and 5% of moderate cases were symptomatic (JAMA 2003;289:194)
• Etiologies (impaired relaxation and/or c passive stiffness): ischemia, prior MI, LVH,
HCMP, infiltrative CMP, RCMP, aging, hypothyroidism
• Precipitants of pulmonary edema: volume overload (poor compliance of LV S sensitive
to even modest c in volume); ischemia (T relaxation); tachycardia (T filling time in
diastole),AF (loss of atrial boost to LV filling); HTN (T afterload S T stroke volume) 
• Dx w/ clinical s/s of HF w/ preserved systolic and impaired diastolic fxn on echo:
abnormal MV inflow: E/A reversal and s in E wave deceleration time
T myocardial relax.: c isovol relax. time & T early diastole tissue Doppler vel
LVH, LAE
• Treatment: diuresis for volume overload, BP control, prevention of tachycardia and
ischemia. No clear benefit of ACEI/ARB in Pts with isolated diastolic HF (Lancet

CARDIOMYOPATHIES
Diseases with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction of the myocardium
DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY (DCMP)
Definition and epidemiology (Circ 2006;113:1807)
• Ventricular dilatation and T contractility 	 T wall thickness,
• Incidence: 5–8 cases/100,000 population per y; prevalence: 1 in 2500
Etiologies (NEJM 1994;331:1564 & 2000;342:1077)
• Ischemia: systolic dysfxn & dilation out of proportion to CAD (poor remodeling post-MI)
• Valvular disease: systolic dysfxn due to chronic volume overload in MR & AI
• Familial (25%): mutations in cytoskeletal, nuclear, and filament proteins (NEJM 1992;362:77)
• Idiopathic (25% of DCMP, ? undiagnosed infectious, alcoholic, or genetic cause)
• Infectious myocarditis (10–15%, autoimmune response to infxn; NEJM 2009;360:1526)
Viruses (coxsackie, adeno, echovirus, CMV): ranging from subacute (dilated LV w/ mild-
mod dysfxn) to fulminant (nondilated, thickened, edematous LV w/ severe dysfxn)
Bacterial, fungal, rickettsial,TB, Lyme (mild myocarditis, often with AVB)
HIV: 8% of asx HIV ; due to HIV vs. other viruses vs. meds (NEJM 1998;339:1093)
Chagas: apical aneurysm 	 thrombus, RBBB, megaesophagus or colon (NEJM 1993;329:639)
• Toxic
Alcohol (5%) typically 7–8 drinks/d  5 y, but much interindividual variability
Anthracyclines (risk c 550 mg/m2, may manifest late), cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab 
Cocaine, antiretrovirals, lead, carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation
• Infiltrative (5%): often mix of DCMP  RCMP (qv) with thickened wall
amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, tumor
• Autoimmune
Collagen vascular disease (3%): polymyositis, SLE, scleroderma, PAN, RA,Wegener’s
Peripartum (last month S 5 mo postpartum): 0.1% of preg.; c risk w/ multiparity &
c age; 50% will improve; ? c risk w/ next preg. (JAMA 2000;283:1183)
Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM): avg age 42 y, fulminant,VT (NEJM 1997;336:1860)
Eosinophilic (variable peripheral eosinophilia): hypersensitivity (mild CHF) or
acute necrotizing (ANEM; STE, effusion, severe CHF)
• Stress-induced (Takotsubo apical ballooning): mimics MI (pain, 	 STE & c Tn; deep TWI
& c QT; mid/apical dyskinesis; ? Rx w/ ACEI; usually improves over wks (NEJM 2005;352:539)
• Tachycardia-induced: likelihood proportional to rate and duration
• Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): fibrofatty replacement
of RV S dilation (dx w/ MRI); ECG: 	 RBBB,TWI V1–V3,  wave; risk VT (Circ 2004;110:1879)
• Metabolic & other: hypothyroidism, acromegaly, pheo, thiamine, sleep apnea
Clinical manifestations
• Heart failure: both congestive & poor forward flow sx; signs of L- & R-sided HF
diffuse, lat.-displaced PMI, S3, 	 MR or TR (annular dilat., displaced pap. muscle)
• Embolic events (10%), arrhythmias & palpitations
• Chest pain can be seen w/ some etiologies (eg, myocarditis)
Diagnostic studies and workup
• CXR: moderate to marked cardiomegaly, 	 pulmonary edema & pleural effusions
• ECG: may see PRWP, Q waves, or BBB; low voltage; AF (20%)
• Echocardiogram: LV dilatation, T EF, regional or global LV HK, 	 RV HK, 	 mural thrombi
• Laboratory evaluation:TFTs, iron studies, HIV, SPEP, ANA; others per clinical suspicion
• Family hx (20–35% w/ familial dis.), genetic counseling 	 genetic testing (JAMA 2009;302:2471)
• Stress test: completely  test useful to r/o ischemic etiology (low false  rate), but
 test does not rule in ischemic etiology (high false  rate, even w/ imaging)
• Coronary angiography to r/o CAD if risk factors, h/o angina, Qw MI on ECG,
equivocal ETT; consider CT angiography (JACC 2007;49:2044) 
• ? Endomyocardial biopsy (JACC 2007;50:1914): yield 10% (of these, 75% myocarditis, 25% 
systemic disease); 40% false  rate (patchy dis.) & false  (necrosis S inflammation)
no proven Rx for myocarditis; ∴biopsy if: acute & hemodyn compromise (r/o GCM,
ANEM); arrhythmia or RCMP features (r/o infiltrative); or suspect toxic, allergic, tumor
• Cardiac MRI: detect myocarditis or infiltrative disease, but nonspecific (EHJ 2005;26:1461)
Treatment (see “Heart Failure” for standard HF Rx)
• Implantation of devices may be tempered by possibility of reversibility of CMP
• Immunosuppression: for giant cell myocarditis (prednisone  AZA), collagen vascular
disease, peripartum (? IVIg), & eosinophilic; no proven benefit for viral myocarditis
• Prognosis differs by etiology (NEJM 2000;342:1077): postpartum (best), ischemic (worst)

HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY (HCMP)
Definition and epidemiology
• LV (usually 15 mm) and/or RV hypertrophy disproportionate to hemodynamic load
• Prevalence: 1 case/500 population; 50% sporadic, 50% familial
• Differentiate from 2 LVH: hypertension (espec. elderly women; NEJM 1985;312:277),AS,
elite athletes (wall thickness usually 13 mm & symmetric and nl/c rates of tissue
Doppler diastolic relaxation; NEJM 1991;324:295), Fabry dis. (c Cr, skin findings)
Pathology
• Autosomal dominant mutations in cardiac sarcomere genes (eg, -myosin heavy chain) 
• Myocardial fiber disarray with hypertrophy
• Morphologic hypertrophy variants: asymmetric septal; concentric; midcavity; apical
Pathophysiology
• Subaortic outflow obstruction: narrowed tract 2 hypertrophied septum  systolic
anterior motion (SAM) of ant. MV leaflet (may be fixed, variable, or nonexistent) and
papillary muscle displacement. Gradient (∇) worse w/ c contractility
(digoxin, -agonists), T preload, or T afterload.
• Mitral regurgitation: due to SAM (mid-to-late, post.-directed regurg. jet) and abnormal
mitral leaflets and papillary muscles (pansystolic, ant.-directed regurg. jet)
• Diastolic dysfunction: c chamber stiffness  impaired relaxation
• Ischemia: small vessel dis., perforating artery compression (bridging), T coronary perfusion
• Syncope: s in load-dependent CO, arrhythmias
Clinical manifestations (70% are asymptomatic at dx)
• Dyspnea (90%): due to c LVEDP, MR, and diastolic dysfunction
• Angina (25%) even w/o epicardial CAD; microvasc. dysfxn (NEJM 2003;349:1027)
• Arrhythmias (AF in 20–25%;VT/VF) S palpitations, syncope, sudden cardiac death
Physical exam
• Sustained PMI, S2 paradox. split if severe outflow obstruction,  S4 (occ. palpable)
• Systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at LLSB: c w/ Valsalva & standing
• 	 mid-to-late or holosystolic murmur of MR at apex
• Bisferiens carotid pulse (brisk rise, decline, then 2nd rise); JVP w/ prominent a wave
• Contrast to AS, which has murmur that T w/ Valsalva and T carotid pulses
Diagnostic studies
• CXR: cardiomegaly (LV and LA)
• ECG: LVH, anterolateral and inferior pseudo-Qw, 	 apical giant TWI (apical variant)
• Echo: no absolute cutoffs for degree of LVH but septum / post wall 1.3 suggestive,
as is septum 15 mm; other findings include dynamic outflow obstruction, SAM, MR
• MRI: hypertrophy  patchy delayed enhancement (useful for dx & prognosis) 
• Cardiac cath: subaortic pressure ∇; Brockenbrough sign  T pulse pressure post-
extrasystolic beat (in contrast to AS, in which pulse pressure c postextrasystole)
Treatment (NEJM 2004;350:1320)
• Heart failure
 inotropes/chronotropes: -blockers, CCB (verapamil), disopyramide.
Careful use of diuretics.Vasodilators only if systolic dysfxn.Avoid digoxin.
If refractory to drug therapy and there is obstructive physiology (∇50 mmHg):
a) Alcohol septal ablation (NEJM 2002;347:1326)
triphasic ∇response: acute T S 	 partial c back to 50% of baseline S T over months
by 1 y resting ∇15 mmHg & stress-induced ∇31 mmHg (J Interv Card 2006;19:319)
complications: transient (& occ. delayed) 3 AVB w/ 10–20% req. PPM;VT
b) Surgical myectomy: long-term sx improvement in 90% (Circ 2005;112:482)
c) ? Dual-chamber pacing, but largely placebo effect (JACC 1997;29:435; Circ 1999;99:2927)
If refractory to drug therapy and there is nonobstructive pathophysiology: transplant
• Acute HF: can be precip. by dehydration or tachycardia; Rx w/ fluids, B, phenylephrine 
• AF: rate control with -blockers, maintain SR with disopyramide, amiodarone
• Sudden cardiac death: ICD (JACC 2003;42:1687). Major risk factors include history of VT/VF,
 FHx SCD, unexplained syncope, NSVT, T SBP or relative HoTN (c SBP 20
mmHg) w/ exercise, LV wall 30 mm; risk 4%/y in high-risk Pts (JAMA 2007;298:405)
• Counsel to avoid dehydration, extreme exertion
• Endocarditis prophylaxis no longer recommended (Circ 2007;16:1736)
• First-degree relatives: periodic screening w/ echo (as timing of HCMP onset variable)

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
AORTIC STENOSIS (AS)
Etiology
• Calcific: predominant cause in Pts 70 y; risk factors include HTN, c chol., ESRD
• Congenital (ie, bicuspid AoV w/ premature calcification): cause in 50% of Pts 70 y
• Rheumatic heart disease (AS usually accompanied by AI and MV disease)
• AS mimickers: subvalvular (HCMP, subAo membrane), supravalvular
Clinical manifestations (usually indicates AVA 1 cm2 or concomitant CAD)
• Angina: c O2 demand (hypertrophy)  T O2 supply (T cor perfusion pressure) 	 CAD
• Syncope (exertional): peripheral vasodil. w/ fixed CO S T MAP S T cerebral perfusion
• Heart failure: outflow obstruct  diastolic dysfxn S pulm. edema; precip. by AF (T LV filling)
• Acquired von Willebrand disease (20% of sev.AS): destruction of vWF (NEJM 2003;349:343)
• Natural hx: usually slowly progressive (AVA T 0.1 cm2 per y, but varies; Circ 1997;95:2262),
until sx develop; mean survival based on sx: angina  5 y; syncope  3 y; CHF  2 y 
Physical examination
• Midsystolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at
RUSB, harsh, high-pitched, radiates to carotids, apex
(holosystolic  Gallavardin effect) c w/ passive leg raise,
T w/ standing & Valsalva
• In contrast, dynamic outflow obstruction (eg, HCMP) T
w/ passive leg raise & c w/ standing & Valsalva
• Ejection click after S1 sometimes heard with bicuspid AoV
• Signs of severity: late-peaking murmur, paradoxically split S2
or inaudible A2, small and delayed carotid pulse (“pulsus
parvus et tardus”), LV heave,  S4 (occasionally palpable)
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LVH, LAE, LBBB,AF (in late disease)
• CXR: cardiomegaly,AoV calcification, poststenotic dilation of
ascending Ao, pulmonary congestion
• Echo: valve morphology, estim pressure gradient & calculate AVA, EF 
• Cardiac cath: pressure gradiant (∇) across AoV,AVA, r/o CAD (in 50% of calcific AS)
• Dobutamine challenge during echo or cath if low EF and ∇30 to differentiate:
afterload mismatch: 20% c SV & c ∇, no  AVA (implies contractile reserve & c EF post-AVR) 
pseudostenosis: 20% c SV, no  in ∇, c AVA (implies low AVA artifact of LV dysfxn)
limited contractile reserve: no  SV, ∇, or AVA (implies EF prob. will not improve w/ AVR)

AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY (AI)
Etiology (Circ 2006;114:422)
• Valve disease (43%)
rheumatic heart disease (usually mixed AS/AI and concomitant MV disease)
bicuspid AoV: natural hx: 1/3 S normal, 1/3 S AS, 1/6 S AI, 1/6 S endocarditis S AI
infective endocarditis
valvulitis: RA, SLE; anorectics (fen/phen) & other serotoninergics (NEJM 2007;356:29,39)
• Root disease (57%)
HTN
aortic aneurysm or dissection, annuloaortic ectasia, Marfan syndrome
aortic inflammation: giant cell,Takayasu’s, ankylosing spond., reactive arthritis, syphilis
Clinical manifestations
• Acute: sudden T forward SV and c LVEDP (noncompliant ventricle) S pulmonary edema
	 hypotension and cardiogenic shock
• Chronic: clinically silent while LV dilates (to c compliance to keep LVEDP low) more
than it hypertrophies S chronic volume overload S LV decompensation S CHF
• Natural hx: variable progression (unlike AS, can be fast or slow); once decompensation
begins, prognosis poor w/o AVR (mortality 10%/y)
Physical examination
• Early diastolic decrescendo murmur at LUSB
(RUSB if dilated Ao root); c/ sitting forward, expir,
handgrip; severity of AI  duration of murmur (except in 
acute and severe late); Austin Flint murmur:mid-to-late diastolic 
rumble at apex (AI jet interfering w/ mitral inflow) 
• Wide pulse pressure due to c stroke volume, hyperdy-
namic pulse S many of classic signs (see table); pulse
pressure narrows in late AI with T LV fxn; bisferiens
(twice-beating) arterial pulse
• PMI diffuse and laterally displaced; soft S1 (early closure of
MV); 	 S3 (Z T EF but rather just volume overload in AI) 
Classic Eponymous Signs in Chronic AI (South Med J 1981;74:459)

Quincke’s pulses
subungual capillary pulsations (low Sp)
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LVH, LAD, abnl repolarization; CXR: cardiomegaly 	 ascending Ao dilatation
• Echo: severity of AI (severe  width of regurgitant jet 65% LVOT, vena contracta
0.6 cm, regurg fraction 50%, regurg orifice 0.3 cm2, flow reversal in descending
Ao); LV size & fxn
Treatment (Circ 2008;118:e523)
• Acute decompensation (consider ischemia and endocarditis as possible precipitants)
surgery usually urgently needed for acute severe AI which is poorly tolerated by LV
IV afterload reduction (nitroprusside) and inotropic support (dobutamine)
	 chronotropic support (c HR S T diastole S T time for regurgitation)
pure vasoconstrictors and IABP contraindicated
• In chronic AI, management decisions based on LV size and fxn (and before sx occur) 
• Surgery (AVR, replacement or repair if possible)

• Medical therapy: vasodilators (nifedipine,ACEI, hydralazine) if severe AI w/ sx or LV
dysfxn & Pt not operative candidate or to improve hemodynamics before AVR;
no clear benefit on clinical outcomes or LV fxn when used to try to prolong compen-
sation in asx severe AI w/ mild LV dilation & nl LV fxn (NEJM 2005;353:1342)

MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR)
Etiology (Lancet 2009;373:1382) 
• Leaflet abnormalities: myxomatous degeneration (MVP), endocarditis, calcific
RHD, valvulitis (collagen-vascular disease), congenital, anorectic drugs
• Functional: inferoapical papillary muscle displacement due to ischemic LV
remodeling or other causes of DCMP; LV annular dilation due to LV dilation 
• Ruptured chordae tendinae: myxomatous, endocarditis, spontaneous, trauma
• Acute papillary muscle dysfxn b/c of ischemia or rupture during MI [usu. posteromedial
papillary m. (supplied by PDA only) vs. anterolateral (suppl. by diags & OMs)]
• HCMP: (see “Cardiomyopathy”)
Clinical manifestations
• Acute: pulmonary edema, hypotension, cardiogenic shock (NEJM 2004;351:1627)
• Chronic: typically asx for yrs, then as LV fails S progressive DOE, fatigue,AF, PHT
• Prognosis: 5-y survival w/ medical therapy is 80% if asx, but only 45% if sx
Physical examination
• High-pitched, blowing, holosystolic murmur at apex;
radiates to axilla; 	 thrill; c w/ handgrip (Se 68%, Sp 92%),
T w/ Valsalva (Se 93%) (NEJM 1988;318:1572)

• Lat. displ. hyperdynamic PMI, obscured S1, widely split S2
(A2 early b/c T LV afterload, P2 late if PHT); 	 S3
• Carotid upstroke brisk (vs. diminished and delayed in AS)
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LAE, LVH, 	 atrial fibrillation
• CXR: dilated LA, dilated LV, 	 pulmonary congestion
• Echo: MV anatomy (ie, cause of MR); MR severity: jet area
(can underestimate eccentric jets), jet width at origin (“vena
contracta”), or effective regurgitant orifice (ERO; predicts survival,
NEJM 2005;352:875); LV fxn (EF should be supranormal if compensated, ∴EF 60% w/ sev.
MR  LV dysfxn);TEE if TTE inconclusive or pre/intraop to guide repair vs. replace

• In Pts undergoing CABG w/ mod/sev fxnal ischemic MR, consider annuloplasty ring
• Percutaneous MV repair: edge-to-edge clip may be noninferior to surgery (EVEREST II,
ACC 2010); annuloplasty band placed in coronary sinus (Circ 2006;113:851) under study 
• Medical: ∅benefit (incl ACEI) in asx Pts; indicated if sx but not an operative candidate

Clinical manifestations (Lancet 2009;374:1271)
• Dyspnea and pulmonary edema (if due to RHD, sx usually begin in 30s)
precipitants: exercise, fever, anemia, volume overload (incl. pregnancy), tachycardia,AF
• Atrial fibrillation: onset often precipitates heart failure in Pts w/ MS
• Embolic events: commonly cerebral, especially in AF or endocarditis
• Pulmonary: hemoptysis, frequent bronchitis (due to congestion), PHT, RV failure
• Ortner’s syndrome: hoarseness from LA compression of recurrent laryngeal nerve
Physical examination
• Low-pitched mid-diastolic rumble at apex
w/ presystolic accentuation (if not in AF); best
heard in L lat decubitus position during expi-
ration, c w/ exercise; severity proportional to
duration (not intensity) of murmur 
• Opening snap (high-pitched early diastolic
sound at apex) from fused leaflet tips;
MVA proportional to S2–OS interval (tighter

Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LAE (“P mitrale”), 	 AF, 	 RVH
• CXR: dilated LA (straightening of left heart border, double density on right, left
mainstem bronchus elevation)
• Echo: estimate pressure gradient (∇), RVSP, valve area, valve echo score (0–16, based on
leaflet mobility & thickening, subvalvular thickening, Ca; exercise TTE if discrepancy
between sx and severity of MS at rest;TEE to assess for LA thrombus before PMV

MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE (MVP)
Definition and Etiology
• Billowing of MV leaflet 2 mm above mitral annulus in parasternal long axis echo view
• Leaflet redundancy from myxomatous proliferation of spongiosa of MV apparatus 
• Idiopathic, familial, and a/w connective tissue diseases (eg, Marfan’s, Ehlers-Danlos)
• Prevalence 1–2.5% of gen. population,  (NEJM 1999;341:1), most common cause of MR
Clinical manifestations (usually asymptomatic)
• MR (from leaflet prolapse or ruptured chordae); infective endocarditis; embolic events
• Arrhythmias, rarely sudden cardiac death
Physical exam
• High-pitched, midsystolic click 	 mid-to-late systolic murmur
T LV volume (standing) S click earlier; c LV volume or afterload S click later, softer
Treatment

Physical examination
• Normal: crisp sounds, 	 soft murmur during forward flow (normal to have small ∇)
• Abnormal: regurgitant murmurs, absent mechanical valve closure sounds
Anticoagulation (Circ 2008;118:e523)

Procedures include noncardiac surgery, invasive procedures, and major dental work (Circ 2008;118:e523)
Correction of overanticoagulation (Circ 2008;118:e626)
• Risk from major bleeding must be weighed against risk of valve thrombosis

• Pericarditis: chest pain that is pleuritic, positional (T by sitting forward), radiates to
trapezius; may be absent in tuberculous, neoplastic, post-XRT, and uremic pericarditis;
	 fever; 	 s/s of systemic etiologies
• Effusion: ranges from asx to tamponade (see below)
Physical exam
• Pericarditis: multiphasic friction rub best heard at LLSB w/ diaphragm of stethoscope
(leathery sound w/ up to 3 components: atrial contraction, ventricular contraction,
ventricular relaxation) that is notoriously variable and evanescent
• Effusion: distant heart sounds, dullness over left posterior lung field due to 
compressive atelectasis from pericardial effusion (Ewart’s sign)
Diagnostic studies (EHJ 2004;25:587; Circ 2006;113:1622)
• ECG: may show diffuse STE (concave up) & PR depression (except in aVR: ST T & PR c),
TWI; classically and in contrast to STEMI,TWI do not occur until STs normalize
Stages: STE & PR T (I); ST & PR normalize (II); diffuse TWI (III);Tw normalize (IV).
May show evidence of large effusion w/ low voltage & electrical alternans (beat-to-
beat  in QRS amplitude and/or axis).
• CXR: if large effusion (250 mL of fluid) S c cardiac silhouette w/ “water-bottle”
heart and epicardial halo
• Echocardiogram: presence, size, & location of effusion; presence of tamponade
physiology; pericarditis itself w/o spec. abnl (∴echo can be nl), although can see
pericardial stranding (fibrin or tumor); can also detect asx myocarditis
• CT will reveal pericardial effusions, often appearing larger than on echocardiography
• CK-MB or troponin ( in 30%, JACC 2003;42:2144) if myopericarditis
Workup for effusion
• r/o infxn: usually apparent from Hx & CXR; ? ✓acute and convalescent serologies
• r/o noninfectious etiologies: BUN, Cr, ANA, RF, screen for common malignancies

• Pericardiocentesis if suspect infxn or malignancy or if effusion large (2 cm)
✓cell counts,TP, LDH, glc, gram stain & Cx,AFB, cytology
ADA, PCR for MTb, and specific tumor markers as indicated by clinical suspicion

high Se (90%) but very low Sp (20%); overall low utility (Chest 1997;111:1213)
• Pericardial bx if suspicion remains for malignancy or tuberculosis
Treatment of pericarditis (EHJ 2004;25:587; Circ 2006;113:1622)
• NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen 600–800 mg tid) 	 colchicine 0.5 mg bid (Circ 2005;112:2012) 
sx usually subside in 1–3 d, continue Rx for 7–14 d (JAMA 2003;289:1150)
• Steroids (usually systemic; occ. intrapericardial) for systemic rheum or autoimmune
disorder, uremic, preg., contraindication to NSAID, or refractory idiopathic dis.
Risks of steroids: ? c rate of relapse, and c osteoporosis, Cushing’s (Circ 2008;118:667).
• Avoid anticoagulants
• Infectious effusion S pericardial drainage (preferably surgically)  systemic antibiotics
• Acute idiopathic effusion self-limited in 70–90% of cases
• Recurrent effusion S consider pericardial window (percutaneous vs. surgical)
PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE
Etiology
• Any cause of pericarditis but especially malignancy, uremia, idiopathic,
proximal aortic dissection with rupture, myocardial rupture
• Rapidly accumulating effusions most likely to cause tamponade as no time for 
pericardium to stretch (c compliance) and accommodate fluid
Pathophysiology (NEJM 2003;349:684)
• c intrapericardial pressure, compression of heart chambers, T venous return S T CO
• Diastolic pressures c & equalize in all cardiac chambers S minimal flow of blood from
RA to RV when TV opens S blunted y descent
• c ventricular interdependence S pulsus paradoxus (pathologic exaggeration of nl physio) 
Inspiration S T intrapericardial & RA pressures S c venous return S c RV size S
septal shift to left.Also, c pulmonary vascular compliance S T pulm venous return.
Result is T LV filling S T LV stroke volume & blood pressure.
Clinical manifestations
• Cardiogenic shock (hypotension, fatigue) without pulmonary edema
• Dyspnea (seen in 85%) may be due to c respiratory drive to augment venous return
Physical exam (JAMA 2007;297:1810)
• Beck’s triad (present in minority): distant heart sounds, c JVP, hypotension
• c JVP (76%) w/ blunted y descent
• Reflex tachycardia (77%), hypotension (26%; occasionally hypertensive), cool extremities
• Pulsus paradoxus (Se 82%, Sp 70%)  T SBP 10 mmHg during inspiration

Can be absent if pre-existing c LVEDP, cardiac arrhythmia, or regional tamponade
• Distant heart sounds (28%), 	 pericardial friction rub (30%)
• Tachypnea but clear lungs
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: T voltage (seen in 42%), electrical alternans, 	 signs of pericarditis
• CXR: c cardiac silhouette (89%)
• Echocardiogram:  effusion, IVC plethora, septal shift with inspiration,
diastolic collapse of RA (Se 85%, Sp 80%) and/or RV (Se 80%, Sp 90%)
respirophasic ’s in transvalvular velocities (c across TV & T across MV w/ inspir.)
postsurgical tamponade may be localized and not easily visible 
• Cardiac cath (right heart and pericardial): elevation (15–30 mmHg) and equalization of
intrapericardial and diastolic pressures (RA, RV, PCWP), blunted y descent in RA
c in stroke volume postpericardiocentesis ultimate proof of tamponade
if RA pressure remains elevated after drainage, may have effusive-constrictive disease
(NEJM 2004;350:469) or myocardial dysfxn (eg, from concomitant myocarditis)
Treatment
• Volume (but be careful as overfilling can worsen tamponade) and  inotropes (avoid B)
• Pericardiocentesis (except if due to aortic or myocardial rupture, in which cases 
consider removing just enough fluid to reverse PEA while awaiting surgery)

CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS
Etiology
• Any cause of pericarditis but especially postviral, radiation, uremia, TB, post-
cardiac surgery, and idiopathic
Pathophysiology
• Rigid pericardium limits diastolic filling S c systemic venous pressures
• Venous return is limited only after early rapid filling phase; ∴rapid T in RA pressure with
atrial relaxation and opening of tricuspid valve and prominent x and y descents
• Kussmaul’s sign: JVP does not decrease with inspiration (c venous return with inspi-
ration, but negative intrathoracic pressure not transmitted to heart because of
rigid pericardium)
Clinical manifestations
• Right-sided  left-sided heart failure
Physical exam
• c JVP with prominent y descent,  Kussmaul’s sign (Ddx:TS, acute cor pulmonale,
RV infarct, RCMP)
• Hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema
• PMI usually not palpable, pericardial knock, usually no pulsus paradoxus
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: nonspecific,AF common in advanced cases
• CXR: calcification (MTb most common cause), especially in lateral view (although does
not necessarily  constriction)
• Echocardiogram: 	 thickened pericardium, “septal bounce”  abrupt posterior dis-
placement of septum during rapid filling in early diastole
• Cardiac catheterization
atria: Ms or Ws (prominent x and y descents)
ventricles: dip-and-plateau or square-root sign (rapid T pressure at onset of
diastole, rapid c to early plateau)

• Location: root (annuloaortic ectasia), thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), thoracoab-
dominal aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
• Type: fusiform (circumferential dilation) vs. saccular (localized dilation)
Epidemiology (Circ 2005;111:816 & 2008;117:242)
• Aortic aneurysms 13th leading cause of death in U.S. (15,000 deaths/y from ruptures)
• TAA: : 1.7:1; usually involves root/asc Ao or descending Ao (arch & thoracoabd rare)
Risk factors: HTN; atherosclerosis; aortitis (Takayasu’s, GCA, spondyloarthritis,
syphilis); congenital (bicuspid AoV,Turner’s); connective tissue diseases
(Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos type IV); familial; chronic Ao dissection; trauma
• AAA: 5% prev. in individuals 65 y; 5–10 more common in  than ; most infrarenal
Risk factors  risk factors for atherosclerosis: smoking, HTN, hyperlipidemia, age, FHx
Pathophysiology (NEJM 2009;361:1114; Nat Med 2009;15:649)
• LaPlace’s law: tension across a cylinder ∝[(P  r) / (wall thickness)]
• TAA: cystic medial necrosis (medial degeneration, mucoid infiltration, apoptosis) 
• AAA: atherosclerosis & inflammation S matrix degeneration S medial weakening
• Inflammatory and infectious (“mycotic”) aneurysms rare
Screening (JAMA 2009;302:2015)
• TAA: no established population screening guidelines
• AAA: ✓for pulsatile abdominal mass in all Pts; U/S for all men 60 y w/ FHx of AAA
and all men 65–75 y w/ prior tobacco use ( J Vasc Surg 2004;39:267; Annals 2005;142:203;)
Diagnostic studies (Circ 2005;111:816)
• Contrast CT: quick, noninvasive, good Se & Sp for all aortic aneurysms
• CXR: often abnormal, but not definitive in TAA
• Abdominal ultrasound: screening and surveillance test of choice for AAA
• TTE/TEE: useful for root and rest of TAA
• MRI: preferred for aortic root imaging for TAA, but also useful in AAA
Treatment (Circ 2006;113;e463; 2008;177:1883; 2010;121:1544)
• Risk factor modification: smoking cessation, LDL-C 70 mg/dL; ? macrolides or
tetracyclines (inhibit MMPs, anti-Chlamydia)
• BP control: -blockers (T dP/dt) T aneurysm growth (NEJM 1994;330:1335); ACEI a/w T
risk of rupture (Lancet 2006;368:659),ARB may T rate of aortic root growth in Marfan (NEJM

Diagnostic studies (Circ 2005;112:3802)
• Check bilateral BP and radial pulses for symmetry
• CXR: abnormal in 60–90% (c mediastinum, effusion), but cannot be used to r/o dissection
• CT: quick, noninvasive, good Se (80% for proximal; 90–95% for distal); multidetector CT
may improve Se; however, if  & high clin. suspicion S additional studies
• TEE: Se 95% for proximal, 80% for distal; can assess coronaries, pericardium,AI

Treatment (Lancet 2008;372:55; Circ 2010;121:1544)
• Medical: T dP/dt targeting HR 60 and SBP 100–120
first with IV -blockers (eg, propranolol, esmolol, labetalol) to blunt reflex c HR &
inotropy that will occur in response to vasodilators

ARRHYTHMIAS
BRADYCARDIAS, AV BLOCK, AND AV DISSOCIATION
Sinus bradycardia (SB) (NEJM 2000;342:703)
• Etiologies: meds (incl B, CCB, amio, Li, dig), c vagal tone (incl. athletes, sleep, IMI),
metabolic (hypoxia, sepsis, myxedema, hypothermia, T glc), OSA, c ICP
• Treatment: usually none required; atropine or pacing if symptomatic
• Most common cause of sinus pause is blocked premature atrial beat
Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) 
• Features may include: periods of unprovoked SB, SA arrest, paroxysms of SB and atrial
tachyarrhythmias (“tachy-brady” syndrome), chronotropic incompetence w/ ETT
• Treatment: meds alone usually fail (adeq. control tachy S unacceptable brady); usually
need combination of meds (B, CCB, dig) for tachy & PPM for brady
AV Block
Type
Features
1	
Prolonged PR (200 ms), all atrial impulses conducted (1:1).
2	 Mobitz I
Progressive c PR until impulse not conducted (S “grouped beating”).
(Wenckebach)
Abnl AV node due to ischemia (IMI), inflammation (myocarditis, MV 
surgery), high vagal tone (athletes), drug-induced.
Classically (50%), absolute c in PR decreases over time (S T RR
intervals, duration of pause 2 preceding RR interval).
AVB usually worsens w/ carotid sinus massage, improves w/ atropine.
Often paroxysmal/asx, no Rx required.
2	 Mobitz II
Occasional or repetitive blocked impulses w/ consistent PR interval.
Abnl His-Purkinje system due to ischemia (AMI), degeneration of
conduction system, infiltrative disease, inflammation/AoV surgery.
AVB usually improves w/ carotid sinus massage, worsens w/ atropine.
Often progresses to 3 AVB. Pacing wire or PPM often required.
3	 (complete)
No AV conduction. Escape, if present, narrow (jxnal) or wide (vent.)
Nb, if 2:1 block, cannot distinguish Type I vs. II 2 AVB (no chance to observe PR prolongation); usually catego-
rize based on other ECG & clinical data. High-grade AVB usually refers to block of 2 successive impulses.
AV dissociation 
• Default: slowing of SA node allows subsidiary pacemaker (eg,AV junction) to take over
• Usurpation: acceleration of subsidiary pacemaker (eg,AV junctional tach,VT)
• 3 AV block: atrial pacemaker unable to capture ventricles, subsidiary pacemaker emerges
distinguish from isorhythmic dissociation (A V rate, ∴some P’s non-conducting)
SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS (SVTS)
Arise above the ventricles, ∴narrow QRS unless aberrant conduction or pre-excitation.
Etiologies of SVT (NEJM 1995;332:162; 2006;354:1039)
Type
Features
Sinus tachycardia (ST)
Caused by pain, fever, hypovolemia, hypoxia,
anemia, anxiety, -agonists, etc.
SA node reentrant tachycardia
Rare. Reentrant loop w/in SA node, discern
(SANRT)
from ST by rapid onset & termination.
Atrial tachycardia (AT)
Originate at site in atria other than SA node.
Seen w/ CAD, COPD, c catechols, EtOH, dig.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)
c automaticity at multiple sites in the atria
Atrial flutter (AFL)
Macroreentry, usually w/in tricuspid annulus
Atrial fibrillation (AF)
Wavelets irregularly passing down AVN, often
originate from the pulmonary veins
AV nodal reentrant tach (AVNRT)
Reentrant circuit using dual pathways w/in AVN
Atrioventricular reciprocating
Reentrant circuit using AVN and accessory
tachycardia (AVRT)
pathway. Orthodromic (conducts down AVN;
usually narrow QRS) vs. antidromic (conducts 
down accessory path; wide QRS).
Nonparoxysmal junctional
c automaticity at AV junction
tachycardia (NPJT)
May see retrograde P waves or AV dissociation
Seen in myo/endocarditis, cardiac surg, IMI, dig.

• Catheter ablation has high overall success rate (AFL/AVNRT 95%, AF 80%)
Complications: stroke, MI, bleeding, perforation, conduction block (JAMA 2007;290:2768)
ACCESSORY PATHWAYS (WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE)
Definitions
• Accessory pathway (bypass tract) of conducting myocardium connect-
ing atria & ventricles, allowing impulses to bypass normal AVN delay
• Preexcitation (WPW) pattern: T PR interval, c QRS width w/ 
wave (slurred onset, can be subtle), ST & Tw abnl (can mimic old IMI);
only seen w/ pathways that conduct antegrade (if pathway only conducts
retrograde then ECG will be normal during SR;“concealed” bypass tract)
• WPW syndrome: accessory pathway  paroxysmal tachycardia
Diagnosis of SVT Type (NEJM 2006;354:1039)
Onset
Abrupt onset/offset suggests reentry (AVNRT,AVRT, SANRT)
Rate
Not diagnostic as most SVTs can range from 140–250 bpm, but:

Tachycardias
• Orthodromic AVRT: narrow-complex SVT (typically), conducting T AVN & c accessory
pathway; requires retrograde conduction and ∴can occur w/ concealed bypass tracts
• Antidromic AVRT: wide-complex SVT, conducting T accessory pathway & c AVN;
requires antegrade conduction and ∴should see WPW pattern during SR
• AF with rapid conduction down accessory pathway, ∴wide-complex irregular SVT;
requires antegrade conduction and ∴should see WPW pattern during SR
Treatment
• AVRT: vagal maneuvers, B, ? CCB; caution w/ adenosine (can precip. AF); have defib-
rillator ready
• AF/AFL w/ conduction down accessory pathway: need to Rx arrhythmia and c pathway
refractoriness; use procainamide, ibutilide, flecainide or cardiovert; avoid CCB & B
(ineffective) and dig/adenosine (can T refractoriness of pathway S c vent. rate SVF)
• Long term: Rx tachycardias w/ radiofrequency ablation or antiarrhythmics (IA, IC)
consider pathway ablation if asx but AVRT or AF inducible on EPS (NEJM 2003;349:1803)
risk of SCD related to how short R-R interval is in AF and if SVT inducible w/ exercise
WIDE-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIAS (WCTS)
Etiologies
• Ventricular tachycardia (VT)
• SVT conducted with aberrancy: either fixed BBB, rate-dependent BBB (usually
RBBB), conduction via an accessory pathway, or atrially-triggered ventricular pacing 
Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MMVT)
• All beats look similar; predominantly upward in V1  RBBB-type vs. downward  LBBB-type
• Etiologies in a structurally abnormal heart: prior MI (scar); CMP; myocarditis;
arrhythmogenic RV CMP (ARVC): incomplete RBBB,
 wave (terminal notch in QRS) & TWI in V1–3 on resting
ECG, LBBB-type VT, dx w/ MRI (Lancet 2009;373:1289)
• Etiologies in a structurally normal heart:
RVOT VT: normal resting ECG, LBBB-type VT w/ inferior axis;
idiopathic LV VT (responds to verapamil)
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT)
• QRS morphology changes from beat to beat
• Etiologies: ischemia; CMP; catecholaminergic;
torsades de pointes (TdP, “twisting of the points”, PMVT  c QT): c QT acquired
(eg, meds, lytes, see “ECG”) or congenital (K/Na channelopathies; Tw abnl; TdP trig-
gered by sympathetic stim [exercise, emotion, sudden loud noises]; Lancet 2008;372:750) 
Brugada syndrome (Na channelopathy): pseudo-RBBB
w/ STE in V1–3 (provoked w/ IA or IC) on resting ECG
Diagnostic clues that favor VT (assume until proven o/w)
• Prior MI, CHF, or LV dysfunction best predictors that WCT is VT (Am J Med 1998;84:53)
• Hemodynamics and rate do not reliably distinguish VT from SVT
• MMVT is regular, but initially it may be slightly irregular, mimicking AF w/ aberrancy;
grossly irregularly irregular rhythm suggests AF w/ aberrancy
• ECG features that favor VT (Circ 1991;83:1649)
AV dissociation (independent P waves, capture or fusion beats) proves VT
very wide QRS (140 ms in RBBB-type or 160 in LBBB-type); extreme axis deviation
QRS morphology atypical for BBB
RBBB-type: absence of tall R’ (or presence of monophasic R) in V1, r/S ratio 1 in V6
LBBB-type: onset to nadir 60–100 ms in V1, q wave in V6
concordance (QRS in all precordial leads w/ same pattern/direction)
Long-term management (JACC 2006;48:1064)
• Workup: echo to ✓LV fxn, cath or stress test to r/o ischemia, ? MRI and/or RV bx to
look for infiltrative CMP or ARVC, ? EP study to assess inducibility
• ICD: 2 prevention after documented VT/VF arrest (unless due to reversible cause)
1 prevention if high-risk, eg, EF 30–35% (see “Heart Failure”), ? ARVD, ? Brugada,
? certain long QT syndromes, severe HCMP
• Medications: -blockers (espec for LQTS), antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone) to suppress
recurrent VT, triggering ICD firing, or if not ICD candidate, anti-tachycardic pacing
• If med a/w TdP S QT 500 	VPBs: d/c med, replete K, give Mg, 	 pacing (JACC 2010;55:934)
• Radiofrequency ablation if isolated VT focus, or if recurrent VT triggering ICD 
firing; ablation before ICD implantation T discharge rate by 40% (Lancet 2010;375:31)

∴either TEE to r/o thrombus or therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 wks prior
• Likelihood of success dependent on AF duration (better 7 d) and atrial size
• Consider pre-Rx w/ antiarrhythmic drugs (especially if 1st attempt fails)
• For pharmacologic cardioversion, class III and IC drugs have best proven efficacy
• Even if SR returns, atria mechanically stunned.Also, greatest likelihood of recurrent AF
in first 3 mos after return to SR, ∴must anticoagulate postcardioversion 4–12 wks.
• “Pill-in-pocket”: if IC drugs have been safely tolerated in Pts w/o ischemic or

• Syncope c/w cardiac cause (lack of prodrome, exertional, resultant trauma)
• Recurrent syncope
• Abnormal cardiac exam or ECG
Treatment

• Orthostatic syncope: volume replete (eg, 500 mL PO q a.m.); if chronic S rise from supine
to standing slowly, compressive stockings, midodrine, fludrocortisone, high Na diet
Prognosis (Ann Emerg Med 1997;29:459; NEJM 2002;347:878)
• 22% overall recurrence rate if idiopathic, else 3% recurrence
• Cardiac syncope: 2-fold c in mort., 20–40% 1-y SCD rate, median survival 6 y
• Unexplained syncope w/ 1.3-fold c in mort., but noncardiac or unexplained syncope w/ nl
ECG, no h/o VT, no HF, age 45 S low recurrence rate and 5% 1-y SCD rate
• Vasovagal syncope: Pts not at increased risk for death, MI, or stroke
• ✓state driving laws and MD reporting requirements. Consider appropriateness of Pt
involvement in exercise/sport, operating machinery, high-risk occupation (eg, pilot).

Cardiac Resynch Therapy (CRT) / Biventricular (BiV) Pacing (JACC 2008;51:2085)
• 3-lead pacemaker (RA, RV, coronary sinus); R S in V1 suggests appropriate LV capture
• Goal: enhance synch RV & LV fxn (c CO, T remodeling, even if nl EF, NEJM 2009;361:2123)
• Pt selection: NYHA III/IV HF despite med Rx  LVEF 35%  QRS 120 ms;
no clear benefit if QRS 120 ms w/ echo dyssynchrony (NEJM 2007;357:2461);
? lesser benefit if chronic AF
• Benefits: T HF sx, T HF hosp., c survival (NEJM 2004;350:2140 & 2005;352:1539); T HF events
compared w/ ICD alone in NYHA I/II & QRS 150 ms (MADIT-CRT, NEJM 2009;361:1329)
Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD) (NEJM 2003;349:1836; JACC 2006;48:1064)
• RV lead capable of defibrillation & pacing ( 	 antitachycardia pacing,ATP); 	 RA lead
• Goal: terminate VT/VF w/ shock or burst of pacing, prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD)
• Patient selection (JACC 2008;51:2085)
2 prevention: survivors of VF arrest, unstable VT w/o reversible cause (NEJM
1997;337:1576); structural heart disease & spontaneous sustained VT (even if asx) 
1 prevention: life expectancy 1 y, LVEF 30% or LVEF 30–35% & NYHA II-III or
LVEF 35–40% & inducible VT/VF (wait 40 d if post-MI or 9 mos for non-
ischemic CMP; NEJM 2009;361:1427); for HCMP,ARVD, Brugada, sarcoid, LQTS,
Chagas, or congenital heart, ICD if risk factors for SCD
• Benefits: T mortality from SCD c/w antiarrhythmics or placebo
• ICD discharge: ✓device to see if appropriate; r/o ischemia; 6 mos driving ban; if recur-
rent VT, ? drug Rx (eg, amio  B, JAMA 2006;295:165) or VT ablation (NEJM 2007;357:2657).
Nb, ablation at time of ICD T risk of VT by 40% (Lancet 2010;375:31).
Device infection (Circ 2010;121:458)
• Presents as pocket infection (warmth, erythema, tenderness) and/or sepsis w/ bacteremia
• Infection in 1⁄2 of Pts w/ S. aureus bacteremia (even w/o s/s and w/  TTE/TEE)
• Treatment: abx and removal of system

Pre-operative testing and therapy
• ECG if 1 risk factor and planned vascular surgery, or if known vascular disease and
intermediate risk surgery. ? prior to any vascular surgery.
• TTE if dyspnea of unknown origin or if HF w/ c dyspnea and no TTE in past 12 mo
• Stress test if active cardiac issues (see above), or vascular surgery w/ 3 risk factors
& it will  mgmt. Overall low PPV to predict periop CV events.
• Coronary revascularization should be based on standard indications (eg,ACS,
refractory sx, lg territory at risk). Has not been shown to  risk of death or
postop MI when done prior to elective vasc. surgery based on perceived cardiac
risk (NEJM 2004;351:2795) or documented extensive ischemia (AJC 2009;103:897), but sys-
tematic angiography T 2–5 y mortality in one vascular surgery trial (JACC 2009;54:989).
• Given need for dual antiplatelet Rx after stenting, wait 4 wk after BMS and ideally
12 mo after DES before discontinuing ADP receptor blockade; continue ASA
• If possible, wait 4–6 wk after MI (even if  ETT or  ETT & revascularized). If no
revasc, wait 6 mo before elective surgery.
• Preop statins: T ischemia & CV events in Pts undergoing vascular surg (NEJM 2009;361:980)
Perioperative -blocker use (Circ 2009;120:2123; JAMA 2010;303:551)
• Conflicting evidence regarding efficacy of B for T periop events. Some studies have
shown T cardiac death & MI (NEJM 1996;335:1713 & 1999;341:1789) whereas another T MI
but c death & stroke and c bradycardia/HoTN (Lancet 2008;371;1839).
• Consider periop B if CAD,  stress test, or 1 cardiac risk factor, espec if vascular surgery  
• Ideally initiate 1 wk prior to surgery and titrate during preop, intraop, and postop peri-
ods to achieve HR 55–65 bpm and BP control. Avoid bradycardia and hypotension.
Postoperative monitoring
• ✓Postop ECG if known CAD or high-risk surgery. Consider if 1 risk factor for CAD.
• ✓Postop troponin only if new ECG s or chest pain suggestive of ACS
