FOREWORD
To the 1st Edition
It is with the greatest enthusiasm that I introduce Pocket Medicine. In an
era of information glut, it will logically be asked,“Why another manual
for medical house officers?” Yet, despite enormous information readily
available in any number of textbooks, or at the push of a key on a com-
puter, it is often that the harried house officer is less helped by the
description of differential diagnosis and therapies than one would wish.
Pocket Medicine is the joint venture between house staff and faculty
expert in a number of medical specialties.This collaboration is designed
to provide a rapid but thoughtful initial approach to medical problems
seen by house officers with great frequency. Questions that frequently
come from faculty to the house staff on rounds, many hours after the
initial interaction between patient and doctor, have been anticipated and
important pathways for arriving at diagnoses and initiating therapies are
presented.This approach will facilitate the evidence-based medicine dis-
cussion that will follow the workup of the patient.This well-conceived
handbook should enhance the ability of every medical house officer to
properly evaluate a patient in a timely fashion and to be stimulated to
think of the evidence supporting the diagnosis and the likely outcome of
therapeutic intervention. Pocket Medicine will prove to be a worthy addi-
tion to medical education and to the care of our patients.

PREFACE
For Jenny, Matteo, and Natalie with love
Written by residents, fellows, and attendings, the mandate for Pocket
Medicine was to provide,in a concise a manner as possible,the key infor-
mation a clinician needs for the initial approach to and management of
the most common inpatient medical problems.
The tremendous response to the previous editions suggests we
were able to help fill an important need for clinicians.With this fourth
edition come several major improvements including: a thorough updat-
ing of every topic; the addition of several new topics (including acute
aortic syndromes, sepsis, obstructive sleep apnea, hepatic vascular dis-
ease, optimal use of diuretics, viral respiratory infections, infections in
susceptible hosts, intensive glycemic control, approach to the patient
with joint pain, and alcohol withdrawal); incorporation of references to
the most recent reviews and important studies published through the
middle of 2010; and the addition of high-resolution chest radiographs,
chest and abdominal CTs, and echocardiograms, and photomicrographs
of peripheral blood smears and urinalyses.We welcome any suggestions
for further improvement.
Of course medicine is far too vast a field to ever summarize in a
textbook of any size. Long monographs have been devoted to many of
the topics discussed herein. Pocket Medicine is meant only as a starting
point to guide one during the initial phases of diagnosis and management
until one has time to consult more definitive resources. Although the
recommendations herein are as evidence-based as possible, medicine is
both a science and an art.As always, sound clinical judgement must be
applied to every scenario.
I am grateful for the support of the house officers, fellows, and
attendings at the Massachusetts General Hospital.It is a privilege to work
with such a knowledgeable,dedicated,and compassionate group of physi-
cians. I always look back on my time there as Chief Resident as one of
the best experiences I have ever had. I am grateful to several outstanding
clinical mentors, including Hasan Bazari, Denny Ausiello, Larry Friedman,
Nesli Basgoz, Mort Swartz, Eric Isselbacher, Bill Dec, Mike Fifer, and
Roman DeSanctis, as well as the late Charlie McCabe and Peter Yurchak.
Special thanks to my parents for their perpetual encouragement and love
and, of course, to my wife, Jennifer Tseng, who, despite being a surgeon, is
my closest advisor, my best friend, and the love of my life.
I hope that you find Pocket Medicine useful throughout the arduous
but incredibly rewarding journey of practicing medicine.

Initial approach
• Focused history: quality & severity of pain; location & radiation; provoking & palliating 
factors; duration, frequency & pattern; setting in which it occurred; associated sx
• Targeted exam: VS (including BP in both arms), cardiac gallops, murmurs, or rubs;
signs of vascular disease (carotid or femoral bruits, T pulses), signs of heart failure;
lung & abdominal exam; chest wall exam for reproducibility of pain
• 12-lead ECG: obtain w/in 10 min; c/w priors & obtain serial ECGs; consider posterior
leads (V7–V9) to reveal isolated posterior MI if hx c/w ACS but ECG unrevealing
• Cardiac biomarkers (Tn, CK-MB): serial testing at presentation, 6–12 h after sx onset
troponin (I/T): most Se & Sp marker; level 99th %ile in approp. clinical setting is dx of MI
detectable 3–6 h after injury, peaks 24 h, may remain elevated for 7–10 d in STEMI
high-sens. assays: 90–95% Se & Sp; 85% Se w/in 3 h of sx onset (NEJM 2009;361:858, 868)
“false ” (non-ACS myonecrosis): myocarditis/toxic CMP, severe CHF, HTN crisis, PE
or severe resp. distress, cardiac trauma/cardioversion, sepsis, SAH, demand ischemia;
? renal failure (T clearance, skeletal myopathy vs. true microinfarctions)
CK-MB: less Se & Sp (skel. muscle, tongue, diaphragm, intestine, uterus, prostate)
• CXR; other imaging (echo, PE CTA, etc.) as indicated based on H&P and initial testing
• Coronary CT angiography: 1⁄2 free of CAD S 0% w/ ACS; 1⁄2 w/ plaque S 17% w/ ACS;
even with signif stenosis, only 35% w/ ACS (JACC 2009;53:1642). ∴good for r/o not r/i.

Exercise tolerance test (stress test) (NEJM 2001;344:1840)
• Indications: dx CAD, evaluate if known CAD &  in clinical status, risk stratify s/p
ACS, evaluate exercise tolerance, localize ischemia (imaging required)
• Contraindications
Absolute: AMI w/in 48 h, high-risk UA, acute PE, severe AS, uncontrolled CHF,
uncontrolled arrhythmias, myopericarditis, acute aortic dissection
Relative: left main CAD, mod valvular stenosis, severe HTN, HCMP, high-degree
AVB, severe electrolyte abnl, inability to exercise
• Exercise: standard Bruce (c speed/incline q3min), modified Bruce (begins w/o tread-
mill incline), submax (if 3 wk post-MI), or sx-limited; hold antianginals if trying to
dx CAD, give if assessing if Pt ischemic on meds
• Pharmacologic: if unable to exer., low exer. tol or recent MI. Se & Sp  exercise;
Preferred if LBBB. Requires imaging since ECG not specific in this setting. Coronary
vasodilators (will reveal CAD, but not tell you if Pt ischemic): regadenoson, dipyri-
damole, or adenosine (may precipitate bradycardia and bronchospasm).
Chronotropes/inotropes (physiologic): dobutamine (may precipitate tachyarrhythmias).
• Imaging: used if uninterpretable ECG (paced, LBBB, resting STT 1 mm, dig., LVH,
WPW), after indeterminate ECG test, pharmacologic tests, or localization of ischemia
SPECT (eg, 99mTc-sestamibi), PET (rubidium-82; usually w/ pharm test), echo, MRI
Test results
• HR (must achieve 85% of max predicted HR [220-age] for exercise test to be dx), BP
response, peak double product (HR  BP), HR recovery (HRpeak– HR1 min later; nl 12)
• Max exercise capacity achieved (METS or min)
• Occurrence of symptoms (at what level of exertion and similarity to presenting sx)
• ECG changes: downsloping or horizontal ST T (1 mm) predictive of CAD (but dis-
tribution of ST T do not localize ischemic territory); STE highly predictive
• Duke treadmill score  exercise min – (5  max ST dev) – (4  angina index) [0 none, 1
nonlimiting, 2 limiting]; score 5 S 1% 1-y mort; –10 to 4 S 2–3%;  –11 S 5%
• Imaging: radionuclide defects or echocardiographic regional wall motion abnormalities
reversible defect  ischemia; fixed defect  infarct
false : breast S ant “defect” and diaphragm S inf “defect”
false  may be seen if balanced (eg, 3VD) ischemia (global T perfusion w/o regional s)
ECG-gating allows assessment of LV systolic function
High-risk test results (PPV 50% for LM or 3VD, ∴consider coronary angiography)
• ECG: ST T 2 mm or 1 mm in stage 1 or in 5 leads or 5 min in recovery; ST c; VT
• Physiologic: T BP, exercise 4 METS, angina during exercise, Duke score  –11; EF 35%
• Radionuclide: 1 lg or 2 mod. reversible defects, transient LV cavity dilation, c lung uptake
Myocardial viability
• Goal: identify hibernating myocardium that could regain fxn after revascularization
• Options: MRI (Se 95%, Sp 70%), PET (Se 90%, Sp 75%), dobutamine stress
echo (Se 70%, Sp 85%); rest-redistribution thallium (Se 90%, Sp 55%)
CT & MR coronary angiography (NEJM 2008;369:2324; Circ 2010;121:2509)
• Image quality best at slower & regular HR (give B if possible, goal HR 55–60)
• Calcium generates artifact for CT angiography
• MRI being studied: angiography, perfusion, LV fxn, hyperenhancement (Circ 2009;119:1671)
Coronary artery calcium score (CACS, NEJM 2008;358:1336; JAMA 2010;303:1610)
• Quantitative evaluation of extent of calcium and thus estimate of plaque burden
• Not able to assess % stenosis of coronary arteries (no IV contrast)
• ? value in asx Pts w/ intermediate Framingham risk score (10–20% 10-y risk) w/ CACS of
0, 1–100, 101–300, and 300 corresponding to low, average, moderate, and high risk
• May be of value as screening text to r/o CAD in sx Pt (CACS 100 S 3% probability
of signif CAD; but high scores have poor specificity)

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY AND REVASCULARIZATION
Indications for coronary angiography in stable CAD or asx Pts
• CCS class III-IV angina despite medical Rx or angina  systolic dysfxn
• High-risk stress test findings (see prior topic)
• Uncertain dx after noninvasive testing (& compelling need to determine dx), occupational
need for definitive dx (eg, pilot), or inability to undergo noninvasive testing
• Systolic dysfxn with unexplained cause
• Survivor of SCD, polymorphic VT, sustained monomorphic VT
• Suspected spasm or nonatherosclerotic cause of ischemia (eg, anomalous coronary)
Pre-cath checklist
• Document peripheral arterial exam (femoral, DP, PT pulses; femoral bruits); NPO 6 h
• ✓CBC, PT, & Cr; give IVF (	 bicarb, acetylcysteine; see “CIAKI”); blood bank sample
• ASA 325 mg; consider clopidogrel preRx (300–600 mg 2–6 h before) vs. prasugrel
at time of PCI (if ACS)
Coronary revascularization in stable CAD (JACC 2004;44:e213 & 2006;47:e1)
• CABG: T mortality c/w med Rx (albeit pre statins & ACEI/ARB) in Pts w/ 3VD, LM,
or 2VD w/ critical prox LAD, and espec. if T EF (but viable myocardium); T repeat
revasc and trend toward T D/MI but c stroke c/w PCI in LM/3VD (NEJM 2009;360:961);
CABG vs. PCI being studied in DM (FREEDOM trial)
• PCI: T angina c/w med Rx; does not T D/MI (COURAGE, NEJM 2007;356:1503); prompt
revasc (PCI or CABG) did not T mortality vs. med Rx in DM (NEJM 2009;360:2503)
• PCI comparable to CABG in Pts w/o 3VD, w/o DM, and nl EF (Lancet 2009;373:1190)
• For stable CAD w/o critical anatomy and w/o T EF, initial focus on optimal med Rx
• If revasc deemed necessary, PCI if limited # of discrete lesions, nl EF, no DM, poor oper-
ative candidate; CABG if extensive or diffuse disease, T EF, DM, or valvular disease
• Fractional flow reserve [ratio of maximal flow (induced by IV or IC adenosine) distal vs.
proximal to a stenosis]: PCI only if 0.8 S T # stents & T D/MI/revasc (NEJM 2009;360:213)
PCI
• Balloon angioplasty (POBA): effective, but c/b dissection & elastic recoil & neointimal
hyperplasia S restenosis; now reserved for small lesions & ? some SVG lesions
• Bare metal stents (BMS): T elastic recoil S 33–50% T restenosis & repeat revasc (to 
10% by 12 mos) c/w POBA; requires ASA lifelong & clopidogrel  4 wks
• Drug-eluting stents (DES): T neointimal hyperplasia S 75% T restenosis, 50% T repeat
revasc (to 5% by 1 y), no c D/MI c/w BMS (NEJM 2008;359:1330); 2nd gen. everolimus DES
promising (NEJM 2010;362:1728); require ASA lifelong & clopidogrel  1 y (Circ 2007;115:813)
• Anticoagulant: UFH (short-acting, rapidly reversible, but need to ✓PTT/ACT), LMWH (no
need for monitoring, but t1/2 8–12 h), bivalirudin (T bleeding, but 	c MI; NEJM 2009;359:688)
Post-PCI complications
• Postprocedure ✓vascular access site, distal pulses, ECG, CBC, Cr, CK-MB
• Bleeding
hematoma/overt bleeding: manual compression, reverse/stop anticoag
retroperitoneal bleed: may present with T Hct 	 back pain; c HR & T BP late;
Dx: abd/pelvic CT (I–); Rx: reverse/stop anticoag, IVF/PRBC as required
if bleeding uncontrolled, consult performing interventionalist or surgery
• Vascular damage
pseudoaneurysm: triad of pain, expansile mass, systolic bruit; Dx: U/S; Rx: manual
compression, U/S-directed compression or thrombin injection, or surgical repair
AV fistula: continuous bruit; Dx: U/S; Rx: surgical repair
T perfusion to LE (embolization, dissection, thrombus): loss of distal pulse; Dx: angio;
Rx: percutaneous or surgical repair
• Peri-procedural MI: 3 ULN of CK-MB occurs in 5–10%; Qw MI in 1%
• Renal failure: contrast-induced manifests w/in 24 h, peaks 3–5 d (see “CIAKI”)
• Cholesterol emboli syndrome (typically in middle-aged & elderly and w/ Ao atheroma)
renal failure (late and progressive, eos in urine); mesenteric ischemia (abd pain,
LGIB, pancreatitis); intact distal pulses but livedo pattern and toe necrosis
• Stent thrombosis: mins to yrs after PCI, typically p/w AMI. Often due to mechanical
prob. (stent underexpansion or unrecognized dissection, typically presents early) or
d/c of antiplt Rx (espec if d/c both ASA & ADP blocker; JAMA 2005;293: 2126). Risk of
late stent thrombosis may be higher with DES than BMS (JACC 2006;48:2584).
• In-stent restenosis: mos after PCI, typically p/w gradual c angina (10% p/w ACS).
Due to combination of elastic recoil and neointimal hyperplasia; T w/ DES vs. BMS.

STEMI
Reperfusion
• Immediate reperfusion (ie, opening occluded culprit coronary artery) is critical
• In PCI-capable hospital, goal should be primary PCI w/in 90 min of 1st medical contact
• In non-PCI-capable hospital, consider transfer to PCI-capable hospital (see below), o/w
fibrinolytic therapy w/in 30 min of hospital presentation
• Do not let decision regarding method of reperfusion delay time to reperfusion
Primary PCI (NEJM 2007;356:47)
• Superior to lysis: 27% T death, 65% T reMI, 54% T stroke, 95% T ICH (Lancet 2003;361:13)
• Thrombus aspiration during angio prior to stenting T mortality (Lancet 2008;371:1915)
• Transfer to center for 1 PCI may also be superior to lysis (NEJM 2003;349:733), see below
Fibrinolysis vs. Hospital Transfer for Primary PCI
Assess Time and Risk
1. Time required for transport to skilled PCI lab: door-to-balloon 90 min &
[door-to-balloon]-[door-to-needle] 1 h favors transfer for PCI
2. Risk from STEMI: high-risk Pts (eg, shock) fare better with mechanical reperfusion
3. Time to presentation: efficacy of lytics T w/ c time from sx onset, espec. 3 h
4. Risk of fibrinolysis: if high risk of ICH or bleeding, PCI safer option
Adapted from ACC/AHA 2004 STEMI Guidelines (Circ 2004;110:e82)
Fibrinolysis
• Indications: sx 12 h and either STE 0.1 mV (1 mm) in 2 contig. leads or LBBB not
known to be old; benefit if sx 12 h less clear; reasonable if persistent sx & STE
• Mortality T 20% in anterior MI or LBBB and 10% in IMI c/w ∅reperfusion Rx
• Prehospital lysis (ie, ambulance): further 17% T in mortality (JAMA 2000;283:2686)
• 1% risk of ICH; high-risk groups include elderly (2% if 75 y), women, low wt
• Although age not contraindic., c risk of ICH in elderly (75 y) makes PCI more attractive

Nonprimary PCI
• Facilitated PCI: upstream lytic, GPI, or GPI  1⁄2 dose lytic before PCI of no benefit
• Rescue PCI if shock, unstable, failed reperfusion or persistent sx (NEJM 2005;353:2758)
• Routine angio 	 PCI w/in 24 h of successful lysis: T D/MI/Revasc (Lancet 2004;364:1045) and
w/in 6 h T reMI, recurrent ischemia & CHF c/w w/in 2 wk (NEJM 2009;360:2705);
∴if lysed at non-PCI capable hospital, consider transfer to PCI-capable hospital ASAP
espec if high-risk presentation (eg, anterior MI, inferior MI w/ low EF or RV infarct,
extensive STE or LBBB, HF, T BP or c HR)

Risk stratification
• Stress test if anatomy undefined or significant residual CAD after PCI of culprit vessel
• Echocardiogram to assess EF; EF c 6% in STEMI over 6 mos (JACC 2007;50:149)
Medications (barring contraindications)
• Aspirin: 162–325 mg/d for 1 mo (BMS) or 3–6 mos (DES); 75–162 mg/d thereafter
• ADP receptor blocker (eg, clopidogrel): 12 mos (? longer if DES); some PPIs may

evidence to date of impact on clinical outcomes (Lancet 2009;374:989; COGENT, TCT 2009) 
• -blocker: 23% T mortality after acute MI
• Statin: high-intensity lipid-lowering (eg, atorvastatin 80 mg, NEJM 2004;350:1495)

PAC
1-12
PA CATHETER AND TAILORED THERAPY 
Rationale
• Cardiac output (CO)  SV  HR; SV depends on LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)
∴manipulate LVEDV to optimize CO while minimizing pulmonary edema
• Balloon at tip of catheter inflated S floats into “wedge” position. Column of blood extends
from tip of catheter, through pulmonary circulation, to a point just proximal to LA. Under
conditions of no flow, PCWP  LA pressure  LVEDP, which is proportional to LVEDV.
• Situations in which these basic assumptions fail:
1) Catheter tip not in West lung zone 3 (and ∴PCWP  alveolar pressure Z LA
pressure); clues include lack of a & v waves and if PA diastolic pressure  PCWP
2) PCWP  LA pressure (eg, mediastinal fibrosis, pulmonary VOD, PV stenosis)
3) Mean LA pressure  LVEDP (eg, MR, MS)
4)  LVEDP-LVEDV relationship (ie, abnl compliance, ∴“nl” LVEDP may not be optimal)
Indications (JACC 1998;32:840 & Circ 2009;119:e391)
• Diagnosis and evaluation
Ddx of shock (cardiogenic vs. distributive; espec. if trial of IVF failed / high-risk) and
of pulmonary edema (cardiogenic vs. not; espec. if trial of diuretic failed / high-risk)
Evaluation of CO, intracardiac shunt, pulmonary HTN, MR, tamponade
• Therapeutics
Tailored therapy to optimize PCWP, SV, SvO2 in heart failure/shock
Guide to vasodilator therapy (eg, inhaled NO, nifedipine) in pulmonary HTN
Guide to perioperative management in some high-risk Pts, pre-transplantation
• Contraindications
Absolute: right-sided endocarditis, thrombus, or mechanical R-sided valve
Relative: coagulopathy (reverse), recent PPM or ICD (place under fluoroscopy), LBBB
(5% risk of RBBB S CHB, place under fluoro), bioprosthetic R-sided valve
Efficacy concerns
• No benefit to routine PAC in high-risk surgery or ARDS (NEJM 2006;354:2213)
• No benefit in decompensated CHF (JAMA 2005;294:1625); untested in cardiogenic shock
• But: 1⁄2 of CO & PCWP clinical estimates incorrect; CVP & PCWP not well correl.; ∴use
PAC to (a) answer hemodynamic ? and then remove, or (b) manage cardiogenic shock
Placement
• Insertion site: R internal jugular or L subclavian veins for “anatomic” flotation into PA 
• Inflate balloon (max 1.5 mL) when advancing and to measure PCWP
• Use resistance to inflation and pressure tracing to avoid overinflation
• Deflate the balloon when withdrawing and at all other times
• CXR should be obtained after bedside placement to assess for catheter position and PTX
• If catheter cannot be successfully floated (typically if severe TR or RV dilatation) or if
another relative contraindication exists, consider fluoroscopic guidance
Complications
• Central venous access: pneumo/hemothorax (1–3%), arterial puncture, air embolism
• Advancement: atrial or ventricular arrhythmias (3% VT), RBBB (5%), catheter knot-
ting, cardiac perforation/tamponade, PA rupture
• Maintenance: infection (especially if catheter 3 d old), thrombus, pulmonary
infarction (1%), PA rupture/pseudoaneurysm (esp. w/ PHT), balloon rupture
Intracardiac pressures
• Transmural pressure ( preload)  measured intracardiac pressure-intrathoracic pressure
• Intrathoracic pressure (usually slightly ) is transmitted to vessels and heart
• Always measure intracardiac pressure at end-expiration, when intrathoracic pressure
closest to 0; (“high point” in spont. breathing Pts;“low point” in Pts on  pressure vent.)
• If c intrathoracic pressure (eg, PEEP), measured PCWP overestimates true transmural
pressures. Can approx by subtracting 1⁄2 PEEP (convert cmH2O to mmHg by  3⁄4).
• PCWP: LV preload best estimated at a wave; risk of pulmonary edema from avg PCWP 
Cardiac output
• Thermodilution: saline injected in RA.  in temp over time measured at thermis-
tor (in PA) is integrated  1/CO. Inaccurate if T CO, sev TR, or shunt.
• Fick method: O2 consumption (L/min)  CO (L/min)  arteriovenous O2 difference.
CO derived by dividing O2 consumption by observed AV O2 difference [10  1.34 ml
O2/g Hb  Hb g/dl  (SaO2 – SvO2)].
Can estimate O2 consumption using wt-based formula, but best to measure (espec
if c metabolism, eg, sepsis).
If SVO2 80%, consider wedged (ie, pulm vein) sat, LSR shunt, impaired O2 utiliza-
tion (severe sepsis, cyanide, carbon monoxide), cc O2 delivery.

HEART FAILURE
Definitions (Braunwald’s Heart Disease, 8th ed., 2008)
• Failure of heart to pump blood forward at sufficient rate to meet metabolic demands of
peripheral tissues, or ability to do so only at abnormally high cardiac filling pressures
• Low output (T cardiac output) vs. high output (c stroke volume 	 c cardiac output)
• Left-sided (pulmonary edema) vs. right-sided (c JVP, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema)
• Backward (c filling pressures, congestion) vs. forward (impaired systemic perfusion)
• Systolic (inability to expel sufficient blood) vs. diastolic (failure to relax and fill normally)
Figure 1-3 Approach to left-sided heart failure
History
• Low output: fatigue, weakness, exercise intolerance,  MS, anorexia
• Congestive: left-sided S dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
right-sided S peripheral edema, RUQ discomfort, bloating, satiety
Functional classification (New York Heart Association class)
• Class I: no sx w/ ordinary activity; class II: sx w/ ordinary activity;
Class III: sx w/ minimal activity; class IV: sx at rest

but only 50% of severe and 5% of moderate cases were symptomatic (JAMA 2003;289:194)
• Etiologies (impaired relaxation and/or c passive stiffness): ischemia, prior MI, LVH,
HCMP, infiltrative CMP, RCMP, aging, hypothyroidism
• Precipitants of pulmonary edema: volume overload (poor compliance of LV S sensitive
to even modest c in volume); ischemia (T relaxation); tachycardia (T filling time in
diastole),AF (loss of atrial boost to LV filling); HTN (T afterload S T stroke volume) 
• Dx w/ clinical s/s of HF w/ preserved systolic and impaired diastolic fxn on echo:
abnormal MV inflow: E/A reversal and s in E wave deceleration time
T myocardial relax.: c isovol relax. time & T early diastole tissue Doppler vel
LVH, LAE
• Treatment: diuresis for volume overload, BP control, prevention of tachycardia and
ischemia. No clear benefit of ACEI/ARB in Pts with isolated diastolic HF (Lancet

CARDIOMYOPATHIES
Diseases with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction of the myocardium
DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY (DCMP)
Definition and epidemiology (Circ 2006;113:1807)
• Ventricular dilatation and T contractility 	 T wall thickness,
• Incidence: 5–8 cases/100,000 population per y; prevalence: 1 in 2500
Etiologies (NEJM 1994;331:1564 & 2000;342:1077)
• Ischemia: systolic dysfxn & dilation out of proportion to CAD (poor remodeling post-MI)
• Valvular disease: systolic dysfxn due to chronic volume overload in MR & AI
• Familial (25%): mutations in cytoskeletal, nuclear, and filament proteins (NEJM 1992;362:77)
• Idiopathic (25% of DCMP, ? undiagnosed infectious, alcoholic, or genetic cause)
• Infectious myocarditis (10–15%, autoimmune response to infxn; NEJM 2009;360:1526)
Viruses (coxsackie, adeno, echovirus, CMV): ranging from subacute (dilated LV w/ mild-
mod dysfxn) to fulminant (nondilated, thickened, edematous LV w/ severe dysfxn)
Bacterial, fungal, rickettsial,TB, Lyme (mild myocarditis, often with AVB)
HIV: 8% of asx HIV ; due to HIV vs. other viruses vs. meds (NEJM 1998;339:1093)
Chagas: apical aneurysm 	 thrombus, RBBB, megaesophagus or colon (NEJM 1993;329:639)
• Toxic
Alcohol (5%) typically 7–8 drinks/d  5 y, but much interindividual variability
Anthracyclines (risk c 550 mg/m2, may manifest late), cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab 
Cocaine, antiretrovirals, lead, carbon monoxide poisoning, radiation
• Infiltrative (5%): often mix of DCMP  RCMP (qv) with thickened wall
amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, tumor
• Autoimmune
Collagen vascular disease (3%): polymyositis, SLE, scleroderma, PAN, RA,Wegener’s
Peripartum (last month S 5 mo postpartum): 0.1% of preg.; c risk w/ multiparity &
c age; 50% will improve; ? c risk w/ next preg. (JAMA 2000;283:1183)
Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (GCM): avg age 42 y, fulminant,VT (NEJM 1997;336:1860)
Eosinophilic (variable peripheral eosinophilia): hypersensitivity (mild CHF) or
acute necrotizing (ANEM; STE, effusion, severe CHF)
• Stress-induced (Takotsubo apical ballooning): mimics MI (pain, 	 STE & c Tn; deep TWI
& c QT; mid/apical dyskinesis; ? Rx w/ ACEI; usually improves over wks (NEJM 2005;352:539)
• Tachycardia-induced: likelihood proportional to rate and duration
• Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): fibrofatty replacement
of RV S dilation (dx w/ MRI); ECG: 	 RBBB,TWI V1–V3,  wave; risk VT (Circ 2004;110:1879)
• Metabolic & other: hypothyroidism, acromegaly, pheo, thiamine, sleep apnea
Clinical manifestations
• Heart failure: both congestive & poor forward flow sx; signs of L- & R-sided HF
diffuse, lat.-displaced PMI, S3, 	 MR or TR (annular dilat., displaced pap. muscle)
• Embolic events (10%), arrhythmias & palpitations
• Chest pain can be seen w/ some etiologies (eg, myocarditis)
Diagnostic studies and workup
• CXR: moderate to marked cardiomegaly, 	 pulmonary edema & pleural effusions
• ECG: may see PRWP, Q waves, or BBB; low voltage; AF (20%)
• Echocardiogram: LV dilatation, T EF, regional or global LV HK, 	 RV HK, 	 mural thrombi
• Laboratory evaluation:TFTs, iron studies, HIV, SPEP, ANA; others per clinical suspicion
• Family hx (20–35% w/ familial dis.), genetic counseling 	 genetic testing (JAMA 2009;302:2471)
• Stress test: completely  test useful to r/o ischemic etiology (low false  rate), but
 test does not rule in ischemic etiology (high false  rate, even w/ imaging)
• Coronary angiography to r/o CAD if risk factors, h/o angina, Qw MI on ECG,
equivocal ETT; consider CT angiography (JACC 2007;49:2044) 
• ? Endomyocardial biopsy (JACC 2007;50:1914): yield 10% (of these, 75% myocarditis, 25% 
systemic disease); 40% false  rate (patchy dis.) & false  (necrosis S inflammation)
no proven Rx for myocarditis; ∴biopsy if: acute & hemodyn compromise (r/o GCM,
ANEM); arrhythmia or RCMP features (r/o infiltrative); or suspect toxic, allergic, tumor
• Cardiac MRI: detect myocarditis or infiltrative disease, but nonspecific (EHJ 2005;26:1461)
Treatment (see “Heart Failure” for standard HF Rx)
• Implantation of devices may be tempered by possibility of reversibility of CMP
• Immunosuppression: for giant cell myocarditis (prednisone  AZA), collagen vascular
disease, peripartum (? IVIg), & eosinophilic; no proven benefit for viral myocarditis
• Prognosis differs by etiology (NEJM 2000;342:1077): postpartum (best), ischemic (worst)

HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY (HCMP)
Definition and epidemiology
• LV (usually 15 mm) and/or RV hypertrophy disproportionate to hemodynamic load
• Prevalence: 1 case/500 population; 50% sporadic, 50% familial
• Differentiate from 2 LVH: hypertension (espec. elderly women; NEJM 1985;312:277),AS,
elite athletes (wall thickness usually 13 mm & symmetric and nl/c rates of tissue
Doppler diastolic relaxation; NEJM 1991;324:295), Fabry dis. (c Cr, skin findings)
Pathology
• Autosomal dominant mutations in cardiac sarcomere genes (eg, -myosin heavy chain) 
• Myocardial fiber disarray with hypertrophy
• Morphologic hypertrophy variants: asymmetric septal; concentric; midcavity; apical
Pathophysiology
• Subaortic outflow obstruction: narrowed tract 2 hypertrophied septum  systolic
anterior motion (SAM) of ant. MV leaflet (may be fixed, variable, or nonexistent) and
papillary muscle displacement. Gradient (∇) worse w/ c contractility
(digoxin, -agonists), T preload, or T afterload.
• Mitral regurgitation: due to SAM (mid-to-late, post.-directed regurg. jet) and abnormal
mitral leaflets and papillary muscles (pansystolic, ant.-directed regurg. jet)
• Diastolic dysfunction: c chamber stiffness  impaired relaxation
• Ischemia: small vessel dis., perforating artery compression (bridging), T coronary perfusion
• Syncope: s in load-dependent CO, arrhythmias
Clinical manifestations (70% are asymptomatic at dx)
• Dyspnea (90%): due to c LVEDP, MR, and diastolic dysfunction
• Angina (25%) even w/o epicardial CAD; microvasc. dysfxn (NEJM 2003;349:1027)
• Arrhythmias (AF in 20–25%;VT/VF) S palpitations, syncope, sudden cardiac death
Physical exam
• Sustained PMI, S2 paradox. split if severe outflow obstruction,  S4 (occ. palpable)
• Systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at LLSB: c w/ Valsalva & standing
• 	 mid-to-late or holosystolic murmur of MR at apex
• Bisferiens carotid pulse (brisk rise, decline, then 2nd rise); JVP w/ prominent a wave
• Contrast to AS, which has murmur that T w/ Valsalva and T carotid pulses
Diagnostic studies
• CXR: cardiomegaly (LV and LA)
• ECG: LVH, anterolateral and inferior pseudo-Qw, 	 apical giant TWI (apical variant)
• Echo: no absolute cutoffs for degree of LVH but septum / post wall 1.3 suggestive,
as is septum 15 mm; other findings include dynamic outflow obstruction, SAM, MR
• MRI: hypertrophy  patchy delayed enhancement (useful for dx & prognosis) 
• Cardiac cath: subaortic pressure ∇; Brockenbrough sign  T pulse pressure post-
extrasystolic beat (in contrast to AS, in which pulse pressure c postextrasystole)
Treatment (NEJM 2004;350:1320)
• Heart failure
 inotropes/chronotropes: -blockers, CCB (verapamil), disopyramide.
Careful use of diuretics.Vasodilators only if systolic dysfxn.Avoid digoxin.
If refractory to drug therapy and there is obstructive physiology (∇50 mmHg):
a) Alcohol septal ablation (NEJM 2002;347:1326)
triphasic ∇response: acute T S 	 partial c back to 50% of baseline S T over months
by 1 y resting ∇15 mmHg & stress-induced ∇31 mmHg (J Interv Card 2006;19:319)
complications: transient (& occ. delayed) 3 AVB w/ 10–20% req. PPM;VT
b) Surgical myectomy: long-term sx improvement in 90% (Circ 2005;112:482)
c) ? Dual-chamber pacing, but largely placebo effect (JACC 1997;29:435; Circ 1999;99:2927)
If refractory to drug therapy and there is nonobstructive pathophysiology: transplant
• Acute HF: can be precip. by dehydration or tachycardia; Rx w/ fluids, B, phenylephrine 
• AF: rate control with -blockers, maintain SR with disopyramide, amiodarone
• Sudden cardiac death: ICD (JACC 2003;42:1687). Major risk factors include history of VT/VF,
 FHx SCD, unexplained syncope, NSVT, T SBP or relative HoTN (c SBP 20
mmHg) w/ exercise, LV wall 30 mm; risk 4%/y in high-risk Pts (JAMA 2007;298:405)
• Counsel to avoid dehydration, extreme exertion
• Endocarditis prophylaxis no longer recommended (Circ 2007;16:1736)
• First-degree relatives: periodic screening w/ echo (as timing of HCMP onset variable)

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
AORTIC STENOSIS (AS)
Etiology
• Calcific: predominant cause in Pts 70 y; risk factors include HTN, c chol., ESRD
• Congenital (ie, bicuspid AoV w/ premature calcification): cause in 50% of Pts 70 y
• Rheumatic heart disease (AS usually accompanied by AI and MV disease)
• AS mimickers: subvalvular (HCMP, subAo membrane), supravalvular
Clinical manifestations (usually indicates AVA 1 cm2 or concomitant CAD)
• Angina: c O2 demand (hypertrophy)  T O2 supply (T cor perfusion pressure) 	 CAD
• Syncope (exertional): peripheral vasodil. w/ fixed CO S T MAP S T cerebral perfusion
• Heart failure: outflow obstruct  diastolic dysfxn S pulm. edema; precip. by AF (T LV filling)
• Acquired von Willebrand disease (20% of sev.AS): destruction of vWF (NEJM 2003;349:343)
• Natural hx: usually slowly progressive (AVA T 0.1 cm2 per y, but varies; Circ 1997;95:2262),
until sx develop; mean survival based on sx: angina  5 y; syncope  3 y; CHF  2 y 
Physical examination
• Midsystolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at
RUSB, harsh, high-pitched, radiates to carotids, apex
(holosystolic  Gallavardin effect) c w/ passive leg raise,
T w/ standing & Valsalva
• In contrast, dynamic outflow obstruction (eg, HCMP) T
w/ passive leg raise & c w/ standing & Valsalva
• Ejection click after S1 sometimes heard with bicuspid AoV
• Signs of severity: late-peaking murmur, paradoxically split S2
or inaudible A2, small and delayed carotid pulse (“pulsus
parvus et tardus”), LV heave,  S4 (occasionally palpable)
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LVH, LAE, LBBB,AF (in late disease)
• CXR: cardiomegaly,AoV calcification, poststenotic dilation of
ascending Ao, pulmonary congestion
• Echo: valve morphology, estim pressure gradient & calculate AVA, EF 
• Cardiac cath: pressure gradiant (∇) across AoV,AVA, r/o CAD (in 50% of calcific AS)
• Dobutamine challenge during echo or cath if low EF and ∇30 to differentiate:
afterload mismatch: 20% c SV & c ∇, no  AVA (implies contractile reserve & c EF post-AVR) 
pseudostenosis: 20% c SV, no  in ∇, c AVA (implies low AVA artifact of LV dysfxn)
limited contractile reserve: no  SV, ∇, or AVA (implies EF prob. will not improve w/ AVR)

AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY (AI)
Etiology (Circ 2006;114:422)
• Valve disease (43%)
rheumatic heart disease (usually mixed AS/AI and concomitant MV disease)
bicuspid AoV: natural hx: 1/3 S normal, 1/3 S AS, 1/6 S AI, 1/6 S endocarditis S AI
infective endocarditis
valvulitis: RA, SLE; anorectics (fen/phen) & other serotoninergics (NEJM 2007;356:29,39)
• Root disease (57%)
HTN
aortic aneurysm or dissection, annuloaortic ectasia, Marfan syndrome
aortic inflammation: giant cell,Takayasu’s, ankylosing spond., reactive arthritis, syphilis
Clinical manifestations
• Acute: sudden T forward SV and c LVEDP (noncompliant ventricle) S pulmonary edema
	 hypotension and cardiogenic shock
• Chronic: clinically silent while LV dilates (to c compliance to keep LVEDP low) more
than it hypertrophies S chronic volume overload S LV decompensation S CHF
• Natural hx: variable progression (unlike AS, can be fast or slow); once decompensation
begins, prognosis poor w/o AVR (mortality 10%/y)
Physical examination
• Early diastolic decrescendo murmur at LUSB
(RUSB if dilated Ao root); c/ sitting forward, expir,
handgrip; severity of AI  duration of murmur (except in 
acute and severe late); Austin Flint murmur:mid-to-late diastolic 
rumble at apex (AI jet interfering w/ mitral inflow) 
• Wide pulse pressure due to c stroke volume, hyperdy-
namic pulse S many of classic signs (see table); pulse
pressure narrows in late AI with T LV fxn; bisferiens
(twice-beating) arterial pulse
• PMI diffuse and laterally displaced; soft S1 (early closure of
MV); 	 S3 (Z T EF but rather just volume overload in AI) 
Classic Eponymous Signs in Chronic AI (South Med J 1981;74:459)

Quincke’s pulses
subungual capillary pulsations (low Sp)
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LVH, LAD, abnl repolarization; CXR: cardiomegaly 	 ascending Ao dilatation
• Echo: severity of AI (severe  width of regurgitant jet 65% LVOT, vena contracta
0.6 cm, regurg fraction 50%, regurg orifice 0.3 cm2, flow reversal in descending
Ao); LV size & fxn
Treatment (Circ 2008;118:e523)
• Acute decompensation (consider ischemia and endocarditis as possible precipitants)
surgery usually urgently needed for acute severe AI which is poorly tolerated by LV
IV afterload reduction (nitroprusside) and inotropic support (dobutamine)
	 chronotropic support (c HR S T diastole S T time for regurgitation)
pure vasoconstrictors and IABP contraindicated
• In chronic AI, management decisions based on LV size and fxn (and before sx occur) 
• Surgery (AVR, replacement or repair if possible)

• Medical therapy: vasodilators (nifedipine,ACEI, hydralazine) if severe AI w/ sx or LV
dysfxn & Pt not operative candidate or to improve hemodynamics before AVR;
no clear benefit on clinical outcomes or LV fxn when used to try to prolong compen-
sation in asx severe AI w/ mild LV dilation & nl LV fxn (NEJM 2005;353:1342)

MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR)
Etiology (Lancet 2009;373:1382) 
• Leaflet abnormalities: myxomatous degeneration (MVP), endocarditis, calcific
RHD, valvulitis (collagen-vascular disease), congenital, anorectic drugs
• Functional: inferoapical papillary muscle displacement due to ischemic LV
remodeling or other causes of DCMP; LV annular dilation due to LV dilation 
• Ruptured chordae tendinae: myxomatous, endocarditis, spontaneous, trauma
• Acute papillary muscle dysfxn b/c of ischemia or rupture during MI [usu. posteromedial
papillary m. (supplied by PDA only) vs. anterolateral (suppl. by diags & OMs)]
• HCMP: (see “Cardiomyopathy”)
Clinical manifestations
• Acute: pulmonary edema, hypotension, cardiogenic shock (NEJM 2004;351:1627)
• Chronic: typically asx for yrs, then as LV fails S progressive DOE, fatigue,AF, PHT
• Prognosis: 5-y survival w/ medical therapy is 80% if asx, but only 45% if sx
Physical examination
• High-pitched, blowing, holosystolic murmur at apex;
radiates to axilla; 	 thrill; c w/ handgrip (Se 68%, Sp 92%),
T w/ Valsalva (Se 93%) (NEJM 1988;318:1572)

• Lat. displ. hyperdynamic PMI, obscured S1, widely split S2
(A2 early b/c T LV afterload, P2 late if PHT); 	 S3
• Carotid upstroke brisk (vs. diminished and delayed in AS)
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LAE, LVH, 	 atrial fibrillation
• CXR: dilated LA, dilated LV, 	 pulmonary congestion
• Echo: MV anatomy (ie, cause of MR); MR severity: jet area
(can underestimate eccentric jets), jet width at origin (“vena
contracta”), or effective regurgitant orifice (ERO; predicts survival,
NEJM 2005;352:875); LV fxn (EF should be supranormal if compensated, ∴EF 60% w/ sev.
MR  LV dysfxn);TEE if TTE inconclusive or pre/intraop to guide repair vs. replace

• In Pts undergoing CABG w/ mod/sev fxnal ischemic MR, consider annuloplasty ring
• Percutaneous MV repair: edge-to-edge clip may be noninferior to surgery (EVEREST II,
ACC 2010); annuloplasty band placed in coronary sinus (Circ 2006;113:851) under study 
• Medical: ∅benefit (incl ACEI) in asx Pts; indicated if sx but not an operative candidate

Clinical manifestations (Lancet 2009;374:1271)
• Dyspnea and pulmonary edema (if due to RHD, sx usually begin in 30s)
precipitants: exercise, fever, anemia, volume overload (incl. pregnancy), tachycardia,AF
• Atrial fibrillation: onset often precipitates heart failure in Pts w/ MS
• Embolic events: commonly cerebral, especially in AF or endocarditis
• Pulmonary: hemoptysis, frequent bronchitis (due to congestion), PHT, RV failure
• Ortner’s syndrome: hoarseness from LA compression of recurrent laryngeal nerve
Physical examination
• Low-pitched mid-diastolic rumble at apex
w/ presystolic accentuation (if not in AF); best
heard in L lat decubitus position during expi-
ration, c w/ exercise; severity proportional to
duration (not intensity) of murmur 
• Opening snap (high-pitched early diastolic
sound at apex) from fused leaflet tips;
MVA proportional to S2–OS interval (tighter

Diagnostic studies
• ECG: LAE (“P mitrale”), 	 AF, 	 RVH
• CXR: dilated LA (straightening of left heart border, double density on right, left
mainstem bronchus elevation)
• Echo: estimate pressure gradient (∇), RVSP, valve area, valve echo score (0–16, based on
leaflet mobility & thickening, subvalvular thickening, Ca; exercise TTE if discrepancy
between sx and severity of MS at rest;TEE to assess for LA thrombus before PMV

MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE (MVP)
Definition and Etiology
• Billowing of MV leaflet 2 mm above mitral annulus in parasternal long axis echo view
• Leaflet redundancy from myxomatous proliferation of spongiosa of MV apparatus 
• Idiopathic, familial, and a/w connective tissue diseases (eg, Marfan’s, Ehlers-Danlos)
• Prevalence 1–2.5% of gen. population,  (NEJM 1999;341:1), most common cause of MR
Clinical manifestations (usually asymptomatic)
• MR (from leaflet prolapse or ruptured chordae); infective endocarditis; embolic events
• Arrhythmias, rarely sudden cardiac death
Physical exam
• High-pitched, midsystolic click 	 mid-to-late systolic murmur
T LV volume (standing) S click earlier; c LV volume or afterload S click later, softer
Treatment

Physical examination
• Normal: crisp sounds, 	 soft murmur during forward flow (normal to have small ∇)
• Abnormal: regurgitant murmurs, absent mechanical valve closure sounds
Anticoagulation (Circ 2008;118:e523)

Procedures include noncardiac surgery, invasive procedures, and major dental work (Circ 2008;118:e523)
Correction of overanticoagulation (Circ 2008;118:e626)
• Risk from major bleeding must be weighed against risk of valve thrombosis

• Pericarditis: chest pain that is pleuritic, positional (T by sitting forward), radiates to
trapezius; may be absent in tuberculous, neoplastic, post-XRT, and uremic pericarditis;
	 fever; 	 s/s of systemic etiologies
• Effusion: ranges from asx to tamponade (see below)
Physical exam
• Pericarditis: multiphasic friction rub best heard at LLSB w/ diaphragm of stethoscope
(leathery sound w/ up to 3 components: atrial contraction, ventricular contraction,
ventricular relaxation) that is notoriously variable and evanescent
• Effusion: distant heart sounds, dullness over left posterior lung field due to 
compressive atelectasis from pericardial effusion (Ewart’s sign)
Diagnostic studies (EHJ 2004;25:587; Circ 2006;113:1622)
• ECG: may show diffuse STE (concave up) & PR depression (except in aVR: ST T & PR c),
TWI; classically and in contrast to STEMI,TWI do not occur until STs normalize
Stages: STE & PR T (I); ST & PR normalize (II); diffuse TWI (III);Tw normalize (IV).
May show evidence of large effusion w/ low voltage & electrical alternans (beat-to-
beat  in QRS amplitude and/or axis).
• CXR: if large effusion (250 mL of fluid) S c cardiac silhouette w/ “water-bottle”
heart and epicardial halo
• Echocardiogram: presence, size, & location of effusion; presence of tamponade
physiology; pericarditis itself w/o spec. abnl (∴echo can be nl), although can see
pericardial stranding (fibrin or tumor); can also detect asx myocarditis
• CT will reveal pericardial effusions, often appearing larger than on echocardiography
• CK-MB or troponin ( in 30%, JACC 2003;42:2144) if myopericarditis
Workup for effusion
• r/o infxn: usually apparent from Hx & CXR; ? ✓acute and convalescent serologies
• r/o noninfectious etiologies: BUN, Cr, ANA, RF, screen for common malignancies

• Pericardiocentesis if suspect infxn or malignancy or if effusion large (2 cm)
✓cell counts,TP, LDH, glc, gram stain & Cx,AFB, cytology
ADA, PCR for MTb, and specific tumor markers as indicated by clinical suspicion

high Se (90%) but very low Sp (20%); overall low utility (Chest 1997;111:1213)
• Pericardial bx if suspicion remains for malignancy or tuberculosis
Treatment of pericarditis (EHJ 2004;25:587; Circ 2006;113:1622)
• NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen 600–800 mg tid) 	 colchicine 0.5 mg bid (Circ 2005;112:2012) 
sx usually subside in 1–3 d, continue Rx for 7–14 d (JAMA 2003;289:1150)
• Steroids (usually systemic; occ. intrapericardial) for systemic rheum or autoimmune
disorder, uremic, preg., contraindication to NSAID, or refractory idiopathic dis.
Risks of steroids: ? c rate of relapse, and c osteoporosis, Cushing’s (Circ 2008;118:667).
• Avoid anticoagulants
• Infectious effusion S pericardial drainage (preferably surgically)  systemic antibiotics
• Acute idiopathic effusion self-limited in 70–90% of cases
• Recurrent effusion S consider pericardial window (percutaneous vs. surgical)
PERICARDIAL TAMPONADE
Etiology
• Any cause of pericarditis but especially malignancy, uremia, idiopathic,
proximal aortic dissection with rupture, myocardial rupture
• Rapidly accumulating effusions most likely to cause tamponade as no time for 
pericardium to stretch (c compliance) and accommodate fluid
Pathophysiology (NEJM 2003;349:684)
• c intrapericardial pressure, compression of heart chambers, T venous return S T CO
• Diastolic pressures c & equalize in all cardiac chambers S minimal flow of blood from
RA to RV when TV opens S blunted y descent
• c ventricular interdependence S pulsus paradoxus (pathologic exaggeration of nl physio) 
Inspiration S T intrapericardial & RA pressures S c venous return S c RV size S
septal shift to left.Also, c pulmonary vascular compliance S T pulm venous return.
Result is T LV filling S T LV stroke volume & blood pressure.
Clinical manifestations
• Cardiogenic shock (hypotension, fatigue) without pulmonary edema
• Dyspnea (seen in 85%) may be due to c respiratory drive to augment venous return
Physical exam (JAMA 2007;297:1810)
• Beck’s triad (present in minority): distant heart sounds, c JVP, hypotension
• c JVP (76%) w/ blunted y descent
• Reflex tachycardia (77%), hypotension (26%; occasionally hypertensive), cool extremities
• Pulsus paradoxus (Se 82%, Sp 70%)  T SBP 10 mmHg during inspiration

Can be absent if pre-existing c LVEDP, cardiac arrhythmia, or regional tamponade
• Distant heart sounds (28%), 	 pericardial friction rub (30%)
• Tachypnea but clear lungs
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: T voltage (seen in 42%), electrical alternans, 	 signs of pericarditis
• CXR: c cardiac silhouette (89%)
• Echocardiogram:  effusion, IVC plethora, septal shift with inspiration,
diastolic collapse of RA (Se 85%, Sp 80%) and/or RV (Se 80%, Sp 90%)
respirophasic ’s in transvalvular velocities (c across TV & T across MV w/ inspir.)
postsurgical tamponade may be localized and not easily visible 
• Cardiac cath (right heart and pericardial): elevation (15–30 mmHg) and equalization of
intrapericardial and diastolic pressures (RA, RV, PCWP), blunted y descent in RA
c in stroke volume postpericardiocentesis ultimate proof of tamponade
if RA pressure remains elevated after drainage, may have effusive-constrictive disease
(NEJM 2004;350:469) or myocardial dysfxn (eg, from concomitant myocarditis)
Treatment
• Volume (but be careful as overfilling can worsen tamponade) and  inotropes (avoid B)
• Pericardiocentesis (except if due to aortic or myocardial rupture, in which cases 
consider removing just enough fluid to reverse PEA while awaiting surgery)

CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS
Etiology
• Any cause of pericarditis but especially postviral, radiation, uremia, TB, post-
cardiac surgery, and idiopathic
Pathophysiology
• Rigid pericardium limits diastolic filling S c systemic venous pressures
• Venous return is limited only after early rapid filling phase; ∴rapid T in RA pressure with
atrial relaxation and opening of tricuspid valve and prominent x and y descents
• Kussmaul’s sign: JVP does not decrease with inspiration (c venous return with inspi-
ration, but negative intrathoracic pressure not transmitted to heart because of
rigid pericardium)
Clinical manifestations
• Right-sided  left-sided heart failure
Physical exam
• c JVP with prominent y descent,  Kussmaul’s sign (Ddx:TS, acute cor pulmonale,
RV infarct, RCMP)
• Hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema
• PMI usually not palpable, pericardial knock, usually no pulsus paradoxus
Diagnostic studies
• ECG: nonspecific,AF common in advanced cases
• CXR: calcification (MTb most common cause), especially in lateral view (although does
not necessarily  constriction)
• Echocardiogram: 	 thickened pericardium, “septal bounce”  abrupt posterior dis-
placement of septum during rapid filling in early diastole
• Cardiac catheterization
atria: Ms or Ws (prominent x and y descents)
ventricles: dip-and-plateau or square-root sign (rapid T pressure at onset of
diastole, rapid c to early plateau)

• Location: root (annuloaortic ectasia), thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), thoracoab-
dominal aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
• Type: fusiform (circumferential dilation) vs. saccular (localized dilation)
Epidemiology (Circ 2005;111:816 & 2008;117:242)
• Aortic aneurysms 13th leading cause of death in U.S. (15,000 deaths/y from ruptures)
• TAA: : 1.7:1; usually involves root/asc Ao or descending Ao (arch & thoracoabd rare)
Risk factors: HTN; atherosclerosis; aortitis (Takayasu’s, GCA, spondyloarthritis,
syphilis); congenital (bicuspid AoV,Turner’s); connective tissue diseases
(Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos type IV); familial; chronic Ao dissection; trauma
• AAA: 5% prev. in individuals 65 y; 5–10 more common in  than ; most infrarenal
Risk factors  risk factors for atherosclerosis: smoking, HTN, hyperlipidemia, age, FHx
Pathophysiology (NEJM 2009;361:1114; Nat Med 2009;15:649)
• LaPlace’s law: tension across a cylinder ∝[(P  r) / (wall thickness)]
• TAA: cystic medial necrosis (medial degeneration, mucoid infiltration, apoptosis) 
• AAA: atherosclerosis & inflammation S matrix degeneration S medial weakening
• Inflammatory and infectious (“mycotic”) aneurysms rare
Screening (JAMA 2009;302:2015)
• TAA: no established population screening guidelines
• AAA: ✓for pulsatile abdominal mass in all Pts; U/S for all men 60 y w/ FHx of AAA
and all men 65–75 y w/ prior tobacco use ( J Vasc Surg 2004;39:267; Annals 2005;142:203;)
Diagnostic studies (Circ 2005;111:816)
• Contrast CT: quick, noninvasive, good Se & Sp for all aortic aneurysms
• CXR: often abnormal, but not definitive in TAA
• Abdominal ultrasound: screening and surveillance test of choice for AAA
• TTE/TEE: useful for root and rest of TAA
• MRI: preferred for aortic root imaging for TAA, but also useful in AAA
Treatment (Circ 2006;113;e463; 2008;177:1883; 2010;121:1544)
• Risk factor modification: smoking cessation, LDL-C 70 mg/dL; ? macrolides or
tetracyclines (inhibit MMPs, anti-Chlamydia)
• BP control: -blockers (T dP/dt) T aneurysm growth (NEJM 1994;330:1335); ACEI a/w T
risk of rupture (Lancet 2006;368:659),ARB may T rate of aortic root growth in Marfan (NEJM

Diagnostic studies (Circ 2005;112:3802)
• Check bilateral BP and radial pulses for symmetry
• CXR: abnormal in 60–90% (c mediastinum, effusion), but cannot be used to r/o dissection
• CT: quick, noninvasive, good Se (80% for proximal; 90–95% for distal); multidetector CT
may improve Se; however, if  & high clin. suspicion S additional studies
• TEE: Se 95% for proximal, 80% for distal; can assess coronaries, pericardium,AI

Treatment (Lancet 2008;372:55; Circ 2010;121:1544)
• Medical: T dP/dt targeting HR 60 and SBP 100–120
first with IV -blockers (eg, propranolol, esmolol, labetalol) to blunt reflex c HR &
inotropy that will occur in response to vasodilators

ARRHYTHMIAS
BRADYCARDIAS, AV BLOCK, AND AV DISSOCIATION
Sinus bradycardia (SB) (NEJM 2000;342:703)
• Etiologies: meds (incl B, CCB, amio, Li, dig), c vagal tone (incl. athletes, sleep, IMI),
metabolic (hypoxia, sepsis, myxedema, hypothermia, T glc), OSA, c ICP
• Treatment: usually none required; atropine or pacing if symptomatic
• Most common cause of sinus pause is blocked premature atrial beat
Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) 
• Features may include: periods of unprovoked SB, SA arrest, paroxysms of SB and atrial
tachyarrhythmias (“tachy-brady” syndrome), chronotropic incompetence w/ ETT
• Treatment: meds alone usually fail (adeq. control tachy S unacceptable brady); usually
need combination of meds (B, CCB, dig) for tachy & PPM for brady
AV Block
Type
Features
1	
Prolonged PR (200 ms), all atrial impulses conducted (1:1).
2	 Mobitz I
Progressive c PR until impulse not conducted (S “grouped beating”).
(Wenckebach)
Abnl AV node due to ischemia (IMI), inflammation (myocarditis, MV 
surgery), high vagal tone (athletes), drug-induced.
Classically (50%), absolute c in PR decreases over time (S T RR
intervals, duration of pause 2 preceding RR interval).
AVB usually worsens w/ carotid sinus massage, improves w/ atropine.
Often paroxysmal/asx, no Rx required.
2	 Mobitz II
Occasional or repetitive blocked impulses w/ consistent PR interval.
Abnl His-Purkinje system due to ischemia (AMI), degeneration of
conduction system, infiltrative disease, inflammation/AoV surgery.
AVB usually improves w/ carotid sinus massage, worsens w/ atropine.
Often progresses to 3 AVB. Pacing wire or PPM often required.
3	 (complete)
No AV conduction. Escape, if present, narrow (jxnal) or wide (vent.)
Nb, if 2:1 block, cannot distinguish Type I vs. II 2 AVB (no chance to observe PR prolongation); usually catego-
rize based on other ECG & clinical data. High-grade AVB usually refers to block of 2 successive impulses.
AV dissociation 
• Default: slowing of SA node allows subsidiary pacemaker (eg,AV junction) to take over
• Usurpation: acceleration of subsidiary pacemaker (eg,AV junctional tach,VT)
• 3 AV block: atrial pacemaker unable to capture ventricles, subsidiary pacemaker emerges
distinguish from isorhythmic dissociation (A V rate, ∴some P’s non-conducting)
SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS (SVTS)
Arise above the ventricles, ∴narrow QRS unless aberrant conduction or pre-excitation.
Etiologies of SVT (NEJM 1995;332:162; 2006;354:1039)
Type
Features
Sinus tachycardia (ST)
Caused by pain, fever, hypovolemia, hypoxia,
anemia, anxiety, -agonists, etc.
SA node reentrant tachycardia
Rare. Reentrant loop w/in SA node, discern
(SANRT)
from ST by rapid onset & termination.
Atrial tachycardia (AT)
Originate at site in atria other than SA node.
Seen w/ CAD, COPD, c catechols, EtOH, dig.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT)
c automaticity at multiple sites in the atria
Atrial flutter (AFL)
Macroreentry, usually w/in tricuspid annulus
Atrial fibrillation (AF)
Wavelets irregularly passing down AVN, often
originate from the pulmonary veins
AV nodal reentrant tach (AVNRT)
Reentrant circuit using dual pathways w/in AVN
Atrioventricular reciprocating
Reentrant circuit using AVN and accessory
tachycardia (AVRT)
pathway. Orthodromic (conducts down AVN;
usually narrow QRS) vs. antidromic (conducts 
down accessory path; wide QRS).
Nonparoxysmal junctional
c automaticity at AV junction
tachycardia (NPJT)
May see retrograde P waves or AV dissociation
Seen in myo/endocarditis, cardiac surg, IMI, dig.

• Catheter ablation has high overall success rate (AFL/AVNRT 95%, AF 80%)
Complications: stroke, MI, bleeding, perforation, conduction block (JAMA 2007;290:2768)
ACCESSORY PATHWAYS (WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE)
Definitions
• Accessory pathway (bypass tract) of conducting myocardium connect-
ing atria & ventricles, allowing impulses to bypass normal AVN delay
• Preexcitation (WPW) pattern: T PR interval, c QRS width w/ 
wave (slurred onset, can be subtle), ST & Tw abnl (can mimic old IMI);
only seen w/ pathways that conduct antegrade (if pathway only conducts
retrograde then ECG will be normal during SR;“concealed” bypass tract)
• WPW syndrome: accessory pathway  paroxysmal tachycardia
Diagnosis of SVT Type (NEJM 2006;354:1039)
Onset
Abrupt onset/offset suggests reentry (AVNRT,AVRT, SANRT)
Rate
Not diagnostic as most SVTs can range from 140–250 bpm, but:

Tachycardias
• Orthodromic AVRT: narrow-complex SVT (typically), conducting T AVN & c accessory
pathway; requires retrograde conduction and ∴can occur w/ concealed bypass tracts
• Antidromic AVRT: wide-complex SVT, conducting T accessory pathway & c AVN;
requires antegrade conduction and ∴should see WPW pattern during SR
• AF with rapid conduction down accessory pathway, ∴wide-complex irregular SVT;
requires antegrade conduction and ∴should see WPW pattern during SR
Treatment
• AVRT: vagal maneuvers, B, ? CCB; caution w/ adenosine (can precip. AF); have defib-
rillator ready
• AF/AFL w/ conduction down accessory pathway: need to Rx arrhythmia and c pathway
refractoriness; use procainamide, ibutilide, flecainide or cardiovert; avoid CCB & B
(ineffective) and dig/adenosine (can T refractoriness of pathway S c vent. rate SVF)
• Long term: Rx tachycardias w/ radiofrequency ablation or antiarrhythmics (IA, IC)
consider pathway ablation if asx but AVRT or AF inducible on EPS (NEJM 2003;349:1803)
risk of SCD related to how short R-R interval is in AF and if SVT inducible w/ exercise
WIDE-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIAS (WCTS)
Etiologies
• Ventricular tachycardia (VT)
• SVT conducted with aberrancy: either fixed BBB, rate-dependent BBB (usually
RBBB), conduction via an accessory pathway, or atrially-triggered ventricular pacing 
Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MMVT)
• All beats look similar; predominantly upward in V1  RBBB-type vs. downward  LBBB-type
• Etiologies in a structurally abnormal heart: prior MI (scar); CMP; myocarditis;
arrhythmogenic RV CMP (ARVC): incomplete RBBB,
 wave (terminal notch in QRS) & TWI in V1–3 on resting
ECG, LBBB-type VT, dx w/ MRI (Lancet 2009;373:1289)
• Etiologies in a structurally normal heart:
RVOT VT: normal resting ECG, LBBB-type VT w/ inferior axis;
idiopathic LV VT (responds to verapamil)
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT)
• QRS morphology changes from beat to beat
• Etiologies: ischemia; CMP; catecholaminergic;
torsades de pointes (TdP, “twisting of the points”, PMVT  c QT): c QT acquired
(eg, meds, lytes, see “ECG”) or congenital (K/Na channelopathies; Tw abnl; TdP trig-
gered by sympathetic stim [exercise, emotion, sudden loud noises]; Lancet 2008;372:750) 
Brugada syndrome (Na channelopathy): pseudo-RBBB
w/ STE in V1–3 (provoked w/ IA or IC) on resting ECG
Diagnostic clues that favor VT (assume until proven o/w)
• Prior MI, CHF, or LV dysfunction best predictors that WCT is VT (Am J Med 1998;84:53)
• Hemodynamics and rate do not reliably distinguish VT from SVT
• MMVT is regular, but initially it may be slightly irregular, mimicking AF w/ aberrancy;
grossly irregularly irregular rhythm suggests AF w/ aberrancy
• ECG features that favor VT (Circ 1991;83:1649)
AV dissociation (independent P waves, capture or fusion beats) proves VT
very wide QRS (140 ms in RBBB-type or 160 in LBBB-type); extreme axis deviation
QRS morphology atypical for BBB
RBBB-type: absence of tall R’ (or presence of monophasic R) in V1, r/S ratio 1 in V6
LBBB-type: onset to nadir 60–100 ms in V1, q wave in V6
concordance (QRS in all precordial leads w/ same pattern/direction)
Long-term management (JACC 2006;48:1064)
• Workup: echo to ✓LV fxn, cath or stress test to r/o ischemia, ? MRI and/or RV bx to
look for infiltrative CMP or ARVC, ? EP study to assess inducibility
• ICD: 2 prevention after documented VT/VF arrest (unless due to reversible cause)
1 prevention if high-risk, eg, EF 30–35% (see “Heart Failure”), ? ARVD, ? Brugada,
? certain long QT syndromes, severe HCMP
• Medications: -blockers (espec for LQTS), antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone) to suppress
recurrent VT, triggering ICD firing, or if not ICD candidate, anti-tachycardic pacing
• If med a/w TdP S QT 500 	VPBs: d/c med, replete K, give Mg, 	 pacing (JACC 2010;55:934)
• Radiofrequency ablation if isolated VT focus, or if recurrent VT triggering ICD 
firing; ablation before ICD implantation T discharge rate by 40% (Lancet 2010;375:31)

∴either TEE to r/o thrombus or therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 wks prior
• Likelihood of success dependent on AF duration (better 7 d) and atrial size
• Consider pre-Rx w/ antiarrhythmic drugs (especially if 1st attempt fails)
• For pharmacologic cardioversion, class III and IC drugs have best proven efficacy
• Even if SR returns, atria mechanically stunned.Also, greatest likelihood of recurrent AF
in first 3 mos after return to SR, ∴must anticoagulate postcardioversion 4–12 wks.
• “Pill-in-pocket”: if IC drugs have been safely tolerated in Pts w/o ischemic or

Cardiac Resynch Therapy (CRT) / Biventricular (BiV) Pacing (JACC 2008;51:2085)
• 3-lead pacemaker (RA, RV, coronary sinus); R S in V1 suggests appropriate LV capture
• Goal: enhance synch RV & LV fxn (c CO, T remodeling, even if nl EF, NEJM 2009;361:2123)
• Pt selection: NYHA III/IV HF despite med Rx  LVEF 35%  QRS 120 ms;
no clear benefit if QRS 120 ms w/ echo dyssynchrony (NEJM 2007;357:2461);

• RV lead capable of defibrillation & pacing ( 	 antitachycardia pacing,ATP); 	 RA lead
• Goal: terminate VT/VF w/ shock or burst of pacing, prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD)
• Patient selection (JACC 2008;51:2085)
2 prevention: survivors of VF arrest, unstable VT w/o reversible cause (NEJM

• Affects 5% population; 85% of cases by age 40 y
Clinical manifestations (NEJM 2001;344:350)
• Classic triad  wheezing, cough, and dyspnea; others include chest tightness,
sputum; symptoms typically chronic with episodic exacerbation
• Precipitants (triggers)
respiratory irritants (smoke, perfume, etc.) & allergens (pets, dust mites, pollen, etc.)
infections (URI, bronchitis, sinusitis)
drugs (eg, ASA & NSAIDs via leukotrienes, B via bronchospasm, MSO4 via histamine)
emotional stress, cold air, exercise
• Exacerbations: important to note frequency, severity, duration, and required treatment
(need for steroids, ED visits, hospitalizations, and intubations)
Physical examination
• Wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase
• Presence of nasal polyps, rhinitis, rash S allergic component
• Exacerbation S c RR, c HR, accessory muscle use, diaphoresis, pulsus paradoxus
Diagnostic studies
• Peak exp flow (PEF): 60 L/min c after bronchodil or 20% diurnal variation sug-
gests asthma. 80% personal best c/w poor control, 50% c/w severe exacerbation.

“Reliever” medications (used prn to quickly relieve sx)
• Short-acting inhaled 2-agonists: albuterol Rx of choice; levoalbuterol (R-isomer) 2x
potency, no outcome benefit, ? less tachycardia (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2008;122:544)
• Inhaled anticholinergics (ipratropium) improve 2-agonist delivery S c bronchodilation
“Controller” meds (taken daily to keep control) (NEJM 2009;360:1002)
• Inh corticosteroids: Rx of choice (JAMA 2001;285:2583). PRN ? as good as daily for mild
asthma (NEJM 2005;352:1519 & 2007;356:2040). PO steroids may be needed for severely
uncontrolled asthma, but avoid if possible b/c systemic side effects.
• Long-acting inh 2-agonists (eg, salmeterol): improves PEF when added to inh steroid
(Lancet 2009;374:1754). Except for control of exercise-induced asthma, should not be
used w/o inh steroid (may c mortality; Chest 2006;129:15 & Annals 2006;144:904). Clinical
relevance of 2-receptor pharmacogenetic interaction not validated 
(Lancet 2009;374:1754).
• Nedocromil/cromolyn: limited use in adults. Useful in young Pts, exercise-induced
bronchospasm; ineffective unless used before trigger or exercise exposure.
• Theophylline: useful in hard to control Pts, PO convenience, but high side effect pro-
file
• Leukotriene modifiers: some Pts very responsive, especially aspirin-sensitive
(AJRCCM 2002;165:9) and exercise-induced  asthma (Annals 2000;132:97).Transcription of
genes for 5-lipoxygenase pathway predicts response (Nat Genet 1999;22:168).
• Anti-IgE: allergic asthma (c IgE) uncontrolled on inh steroids (NEJM 2006;354:2689), not
cost-effective for most cases of severe asthma (JACI 2007;120:1146)

Other
• Behavior modification: identify and avoid triggers
• Immunotherapy (eg, desensitization): may be useful if significant allergic component
• TNF antagonists may be helpful in Pts w/ refractory asthma (NEJM 2006;354:697)
• Anti-IL5 found to spare steroids in uncontrolled Pts w/ sputum eos (NEJM 2009;360:985)

EXACERBATION
Direct evaluation
• History
Asthma Hx: baseline PEF, steroid requirement, ED visits, hospital admissions;
previous need for intubation a good predictor of risk of death (Thorax 1986;41:833)
Current exacerbation: duration, severity, potential precipitants, meds used
• Physical exam
Signs of severity: tachypnea, tachycardia, diaphoresis, cyanosis, fragmented speech,
absent breath sounds, accessory muscle use, pulsus paradoxus, abdominal paradox
Assess for barotrauma: asymmetric breath sounds, tracheal deviation, subcutaneous
air S pneumothorax, precordial (Hamman’s) crunch S pneumomediastinum
• Diagnostic studies
ABG: not always considered essential because exam and SaO2 provide equivalent info;
low PaCO2 initially; nl or high PaCO2 may signify tiring; may respond to bronchodilator
PEF: used to follow clinical course; CXR: not essential unless suspicion for PNA or PTX

asthma in past 1 y, current or recent use of PO steroids, not using inh steroids, overdependent on rapid-
acting 2-agonists, psych issues, h/o noncompliance.
Other treatments
• Epinephrine (0.3–0.5 mL SC of 1:1000 dilution): no advantage over inhaled 2-agonists
• Abx: not needed w/o evidence of bacterial infection. Evidence of improved sx & FEV1
may be related to anti-inflammatory effect (NEJM 2006;354:1589; Chest 2009;136:498).
ICU-level care
• High-dose steroids: methylprednisolone 125 mg IV q6h (Archives 1983;143:1324)
• Noninvasive ventilation: likely improves obstruction (Chest 2003;123:1018), but con-
troversial. Consider if mod distress, resp failure not imminent (Resp Care 2008;53:740).
• Invasive ventilation:
large ET tube, keep Pplat 30 cm H2O (predicts barotrauma better than PIP), maxi-
mize exp time, and use no PEEP to avoid hyperinflation (Resp Care 2008;53:740)
paralysis, inhalational anesthetics, bronchoalveolar lavage w/ mucolytic, heliox
(need 60–80% helium), and ECMO have been used with success

HEMOPTYSIS
Definition and pathophysiology
• Expectoration of blood or blood-streaked sputum
• Massive hemoptysis: 600 mL/24–48 h;gas exchange more important than blood loss
• Massive hemoptysis usually from tortuous or invaded bronchial arteries
Etiologies
Infection/
Bronchitis (most common cause of trivial hemoptysis)
Inflammation
Bronchiectasis incl. CF (common cause of massive hemoptysis)
Tuberculosis or aspergilloma (can be massive)
Pneumonia or lung abscess
Neoplasm
Usually primary lung cancer, sometimes metastasis (can be massive)
Cardiovascular
PE (can be massive), pulmonary artery rupture (2	 to instrumentation),
CHF, mitral stenosis, trauma/foreign body, bronchovascular fistula
Other
Vasculitis (Wegener’s, Goodpasture’s, Behçet’s; can be massive),
AVM, anticoagulation (w/ underlying lung disease), coagulopathy,
cocaine, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, catamenial (lung 
endometriosis)
(Crit Care Med 2000;28:1642)
Diagnostic workup
• Localize bleeding site
Rule out GI or ENT source by exam, history; may require endoscopy
Pulmonary source: determine whether unilateral or bilateral, localized or
diffuse, parenchymal or airway by CXR or chest CT, bronchoscopy if necessary
• PT, PTT, CBC to rule out coagulopathy
• Sputum culture/stain for bacteria, fungi, and AFB; cytology to r/o malignancy
• ANCA, anti-GBM, urinalysis to ✓for vasculitis or pulmonary-renal syndrome
Treatment
• Mechanism of death is asphyxiation not exsanguination; maintain gas exchange, reverse
coagulation and treat underlying condition; cough supp. may c risk of asphyxiation
• Massive hemoptysis: put bleeding side dependent; selectively intubate nl lung if needed
Angiography: used for Dx & Rx (vascular occlusion balloons or selective embolization
of bronchial circulation)
Rigid bronchoscopy: allows more interventional options (electrocautery, laser) than flex.
Surgical resection
SOLITARY PULMONARY NODULE

• CT: size/shape, Ca, LAN, effusions, bony destruction, c/w old studies
∅Ca S c likelihood malignant; laminated S granuloma; “popcorn” S hamartoma
Diagnostic studies
• PET: detects metab. activity of tumors, 97% Se & 78% Sp for malig. (espec if 8 mm)
also useful for surgical staging b/c may detect unsuspected mets (Lancet 2001;2:659)
useful in deciding which lesions to bx vs. follow w/ serial CT (J Thor Oncol 2006;1:71)
• Transthoracic needle biopsy: if tech. feasible, 97% will obtain definitive tissue dx
(AJR 2005;185:1294); if noninformative or malignant S resect
• Video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS): for percutaneously inaccessible lesions;
highly sensitive and allows resection; has replaced thoracotomy
• Transbronchial bx: most lesions too small to reliably sample w/o endobronchial
U/S (Chest 2003;123:604); bronch w/ brushings low-yield unless invading bronchus
• PPD, fungal serologies,ANCA
Management
• Low-risk: serial CT (q3mo  4, then q6mo  2); shared decision w/ Pt regarding bx
• Intermediate-risk: PET, transthoracic needle bx or transbronchial bx depending on
location, comorbidities and Pt preference; if noninformative S VATS

PLEURAL EFFUSION
Pathophysiology
• Systemic factors (eg, c PCWP, T oncotic pressure) S transudative effusion
• Local factors (ie,  pleural surface permeability) S exudative effusion
Transudates
• Congestive heart failure (40%): 80% bilateral,  cardiomegaly on CXR
occasionally exudative (especially after aggressive diuresis or if chronic), but 75% of
exudative effusions in CHF Pts found to have non-CHF cause (Chest 2002;122:1518)
• Constrictive pericarditis (knock on exam, calcification or thickening on imaging)
• Cirrhosis (“hepatic hydrothorax”): diaphragmatic defect w/ passage of ascitic fluid
often right-sided (2⁄3) & massive (even w/o marked ascites)
• Nephrotic syndrome: usually small, bilateral, asymptomatic (r/o PE b/c hypercoag)
• Other: PE (usually exudate), malignancy (lymphatic obstruction), myxedema, CAPD
Exudates
• Lung parenchymal infection (25%)
bacterial (parapneumonic): can evolve along spectrum of exudative (but sterile) S
fibropurulent (infected fluid) S organization (fibrosis & formation of rigid pleural peel).
Common causes: Strep pneumo, Staph aureus, Strep milleri, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas,
Haemophilus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, mixed flora in aspiration pneumonia.
mycobacterial: 50% lymphs 80% of the time, ADA 40, pleural bx 70% Se
fungal, viral (usually small), parasitic (eg, amebiasis, echinococcosis, paragonimiasis)
• Malignancy (15%): primary lung cancer most common, metastases (especially breast,
lymphoma, etc.), mesothelioma (✓serum osteopontin levels; NEJM 2005;353:15)
• Pulmonary embolism (10%): effusions in 40% of PEs; exudate (75%)  transudate
(25%); hemorrhagic—must have high suspicion b/c presentation highly variable
• Collagen vascular disease: RA (large), SLE (small),Wegener’s, Churg-Strauss
• Gastrointestinal diseases: pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, abdominal abscess
• Hemothorax (Hcteff/Hctblood 50%): trauma, PE, malignancy, coagulopathy, leaking aortic
aneurysm, aortic dissection, pulmonary vascular malformation
• Chylothorax (triglycerides 110): thoracic duct damage due to trauma, malignancy, LAM
• Other: post-CABG: left-sided; initially bloody, clears after several wks
Dressler’s syndrome (pericarditis & pleuritis post-MI), uremia, post-radiation therapy
Asbestos exposure: benign;  eosinophils
Drug-induced (eg, nitrofurantoin, methysergide, bromocriptine, amiodarone):  eos
Uremia; post-XRT; sarcoidosis
Meigs’ syndrome 
 benign ovarian tumor S ascites & pleural effusion
Yellow-nail syndrome: yellow nails, lymphedema, pleural effusion, bronchiectasis
Diagnostic studies
• Thoracentesis (NEJM 2006;355:e16)
Indications: all effusions 1 cm in decubitus view
if suspect due to CHF, can diurese and see if effusions resolve (75% do so in 48 h) 
asymmetry, fever, chest pain, or failure to resolve S thoracentesis
parapneumonics should be tapped ASAP (cannot exclude infxn clinically)
Diagnostic studies: ✓total protein, LDH, glucose, cell count w/ differential, gram stain &
culture, pH; remaining fluid for additional studies as dictated by clinical scenario
Complications: PTX (5–10%), hemothorax (1%), re-expansion pulm. edema (if 1.5 L
removed), spleen/liver lac.; post-tap CXR not routinely needed (Annals 1996;124:816)
• Transudate vs. exudate (Annals 1972;77:507)
Light’s criteria: exudate 
 TPeff/TPserum 0.5 or LDHeff/LDHserum 0.6 or LDHeff
2⁄3 ULN of LDHserum; 98% Se, 83% Sp; best Se of all methods (Chest 1995;107:1604);
however, will misidentify 25% of transudates as exudates;  if clinically suspect
transudate but meets criterion for exudate, confirm w/ test w/ higher Sp
exudative criteria w/ better Sp: serum-effusion alb gradient 1.2, Se 87%, Sp 92%;
serum-effusion TP gradient 3.1, Se 84%, Sp 91%; choleff 45 mg/dL and LDHeff
200, 90% Se, 98% Sp (no serum required)
CHF effusions: TP may c with diuresis or chronicity S “pseudoexudate”; use albumin
gradient 1.2, choleff 60 mg/dL (Se 54%, Sp 92%), or clinical judgment to help
distinguish (Chest 2002;122:1524)
• Complicated vs. uncomplicated parapneumonic (Chest 1995;108:299)
complicated 
  gram stain or culture or pH 7.2 or glucose 60
complicated parapneumonic effusions usually require drainage to achieve resolution
empyema 
 frank pus, also needs drainage to achieve resolution

(although largest trial used lytics late and w/ small-bore chest tubes; NEJM 2005;352:865)
• Malignant effusion: serial thoracenteses vs. tube thoracostomy  pleurodesis (success rate
80–90%) vs. indwelling pleural catheter for outPts (Cochrane database 2004;CD002916);
choice of specific pleurodesis agent (talc, bleo, doxy) controversial; systemic steroids

• TB effusions: effusion will often resolve spontaneously; however, treat Pt for active TB
• Hepatic hydrothorax
Rx:  pressure gradient (ie, T ascitic fluid volume, NIPPV)
avoid chest tubes; prn thoracenteses, pleurodesis,TIPS or VATS closure of diaphragmatic
defects if medical Rx fails; NIPPV for acute short-term management
spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBEM) can occur (even w/o SBP being present),
∴thoracentesis if suspect infection

• Clinical: hypotension and/or tachycardia (30% mortality), hypoxemia
• CTA: RV / LV dimension ratio 0.9 (Circ 2004;110:3276)
• Biomarkers: c troponin (Circ 2002;106:1263), c BNP (Circ 2003;107:1576) a/w c mortality
• Echocardiogram: RV dysfxn (controversial in absence of hypotension)
Treatment of VTE (Chest 2008;133;454S; NEJM 2008;359:2804)
• LE DVT: calf or proximal S anticoagulate (even if asx)
• UE DVT: anticoagulate (same guidelines as LE). If catheter-associated, need not
remove if catheter fxnal and ongoing need for catheter
• Superficial venous thrombosis: anticoagulate (especially if extensive clot) as 10%
experience thromboembolic event w/in 3 mo (Annals 2010;152:218)
• Acute anticoagulation (initiate immediately if high clinical suspicion!)

MECHANICAL VENTILATION
Indications
• Improve gas exchange
c oxygenation
c alveolar ventilation and/or reverse acute respiratory acidosis
• Relieve respiratory distress
T work of breathing (can account for up to 50% of total oxygen consumption)
T respiratory muscle fatigue
• Apnea, airway protection, pulmonary toilet
Choosing settings (NEJM 2001;344:1986)
1. Choose method (including potentially noninvasive ventilation, see later)
2. Pick ventilator mode, and (if appropriate) volume targeted or pressure targeted
3. Set or ✓remaining variables (eg, FiO2, PEEP, I:E time, flow, airway pressures)
Step 1: Pick Ventilator Mode
Mode
Description
Assist control
Vent delivers a minimum number of supported breaths
(AC)
Additional Pt-initiated breaths trigger fully-assisted vent breaths
∴Vent-triggered breaths identical to Pt-triggered breaths
Tachypnea S ? respiratory alkalosis, breath-stacking, & auto-PEEP
May be pressure targeted or volume targeted
Synchronized
Vent delivers min. # supported breaths (synch. to Pt’s efforts)

∴Vent-assisted breaths Z spontaneous breaths
(SIMV)
Must overcome resp. circuit during spont. breaths S c fatigue

ECMO and ECCO2R (Ann Surg 2004;240:595)
Step 2: Choose Volume Targeted or Pressure Targeted
Volume 
Vent delivers a set VT
targeted
Airway pressures depend on airway resist. & lung/chest wall compliance
Benefit: c control over ventilation (ideal initial ventilator setting);
evidence-based benefit in ALI/ARDS; easy to measure mechanical
respiratory properties (PIP, Pplat, airway resistance, compliance)
Risk: Patient at risk for c pressures S barotrauma (and volutrauma if set
volume too high!)
Volume control (VC) : in AC or SIMV mode, vent delivers variable pressure 
(depending on real-time lung compliance) to achieve set VT. Volume support 
(VS) sample principle in spontaneous mode.
Pressure 
Vent delivers a fixed inspiratory pressure regardless of VT
targeted
VT depends on airway resistance and lung/chest wall compliance
Benefit: May c patient comfort (PSV) requiring less sedation
Risk: Pt at risk for T volumes S inadequate VE
Other
Proportional assist ventilation (PAV): vent delivers variable pressure 
(depending on real-time lung mech.) to achieve targeted % of work of 
breathing
Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV): vent keeps lungs inflated at high 
pressure w/ intermittent release to allow for exhalation via passive recoil
Neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA): vent support proportional to 
diaphragmatic electrical activity sensed using esophageal electrode
General 
Institutional/practitioner preference and patient comfort usually
principles
dictate ventilator strategy; no strategy has proven superior
Common reasons for  include: dyssynchrony, poor gas exchange,  mech.
resp properties, goals of care (eg, sedation, weaning, lung protection)
Alarms can be set for c volumes and c airway pressures in pressure-
targeted and volume-targeted strategies, respectively

Weaning from the ventilator
• Weaning strategy: spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for Pts who meet screening 
criteria (qv) better than gradual weaning of PSV or SIMV (NEJM 1995;332:345). Daily
awakening (d/c all sedation; pass if open eyes & w/o: agitation, RR 35, SaO2
88%, resp distress or arrhythmias) followed by SBT better than SBT alone 
(Lancet 2008;371:126).
• Identify Pts who can breathe spontaneously (NEJM 1991;324:1445 & 1996;335:1864)
screening criteria: sedation reversed, VS stable, minimal secretions, adequate cough,
cause of respiratory failure or previously failed SBT reversed
vent parameters: PaO2/FiO2 200, PEEP 5, f/VT 105, VE 12 L/min, VC 10 mL/kg
rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT) 105 predicts failure; NPV 0.95 (NEJM 1991;324:1445)
• SBT 
 CPAP or T piece  30–120 min (AJRCCM 1999;159:512)
failure if: deteriorating ABGs, c RR, c or T HR, c or T BP, diaphoresis, anxiety
• Tolerate SBT S extubation. Fail SBT S ? cause S work to correct S retry SBT qd
Complications
• Barotrauma and volutrauma (eg, PTX, pneumomediastinum)
high PIPs usually safe unless c Pplat (30 cm H2O, but lower better) S alveolar damage
• Oxygen toxicity (theoretical); proportional to duration  degree of c oxygen (FiO2 0.6)
• Alterations in cardiac output (eg, PEEP can T preload S hypotension)
• Ventilator-associated pneumonia (1%/day, mortality rate 30%)
typical pathogens: MRSA, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter species
preventive strategies (AJRCCM 2005;171:388): wash hands, semirecumbent position, 
non-nasal intub, enteral nutrition rather than TPN, routine suction of subglottic
secretions, avoid unnecessary abx & transfusions, routine oral antiseptic, 
stress-ulcer prophylaxis w/ ? sucralfate (TVAP, c GIB) vs. H2RA/PPI, ? silver-coated
tubes (JAMA 2008;300:805)
• Laryngeal
edema: for Pts vent 36 h; ? predicted by  cuff leak test. Methylprednisolone 20 mg IV
q4h starting 12 h pre-extub S TT edema and 50% T in reintubation (Lancet 2007;369:1003)
ulceration: consider tracheostomy for patients in whom expect 14 d of mech. vent S
T duration mech. vent, T # ICU days (BMJ 2005;330:1243); no benefit to performing at
1 wk vs. waiting until 2 wk (JAMA 2010;303:1483)

ARDS
2-22
ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME
Definition & Presentation (NEJM 2000;342:1334; American-Euro Consensus Conf 1994)
• Acute onset (24 h)
• Bilateral patchy airspace disease (need not be diffuse)
• Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (PCWP 18 or no clinical evidence of c LAP)
• Severe hypoxemia: PaO2/FiO2 200 S ARDS; PaO2/FiO2 300 S ALI (acute lung injury)
• Chest CT: heterogeneous lung with densities greater in dependent areas
• Lung bx: classically shows diffuse alveolar damage (DAD); bx not required but often
provides useful dx information (Chest 2004;125:197)
Pathophysiology
• c intrapulmonary shunt S hypoxemia (∴Rx w/ PEEP to prevent derecruitment)
• c increased dead space fraction (see appendix), predicts c mort. (NEJM 2002;346:1281)
• T compliance: VT/(Pplat – PEEP) 50 mL/cm H2O
Etiologies
Direct Injury
Indirect Injury
• Pneumonia (40%)
• Inhalation injury
• Sepsis (25%) • Pancreatitis
• Aspiration (15%)
• Lung contusion
• Shock
• Trauma/multiple fractures
• Near drowning
• DIC
• Transfusion (TRALI)
Treatment (primarily supportive) (Lancet 2007;369:1553 & NEJM 2007;357:1113)
• Goal is to maintain gas exchange, sustain life, & avoid ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)

Variable benefit in different studies, Pt subgps. No 
benefit at given VT if titrated to PaO2 alone (NEJM
2004;351:327; JAMA 2008;299:637). If titrated to Pplat 28–30

(JAMA 2008;299:646), ? T mortality (JAMA 2010;303:865).
If able to c PEEP w/o c Pplat, suggests “recruitability.”
∴c PEEP if S c SaO2; target SaO2 88–90% & Pplat 30

*See ARDSnet.org for ventilator protocol.
• Fluid balance: target CVP 4–6 cm H2O (if nonoliguric & normotensive) S c
vent/ICU-free days, but no mortality difference (NEJM 2006;354:2564)
• PA catheter for fluid management S c complications vs. CVP only (NEJM 2006;354:2213)
• Steroids: debate continues. Adverse effects include neuromuscular weakness, poor
glc control, ? infection. Benefit may vary by time since ARDS onset:
72 h: older studies w/o benefit (NEJM 1987;317:1565); ? T mort, c vent/ICU-free days
in recent, controversial study (Chest 2007;131:954)
7–13 d: ? benefit S c vent/ICU-free days, no mortality difference (NEJM 2006;354:1671)
14 d: c mortality (NEJM 2006;354:1671)
• Experimental:
Inhaled nitric oxide: no proven T PAP, can c PaO2/FiO2, no T mort or vent-free days
(BMJ 2007;334:779); inhaled prostacyclins similar physiologically, similar effect
Prone ventilation: c PaO2, but c complications and no T mortality (JAMA 2009;302:1977)
High-frequency oscillatory ventilation: no mort benefit (AJRCCM 2002;166:801), can tran-
siently c PaO2 (Chest 2007;131:1907)
Lung recruitment: apply CPAP 40–45 cm H2O  2 min to recruit lung and then c
PEEP to maintain; sicker Pts had c recruitable lung (NEJM 2006;354:1775, 1839)
ECMO: may be useful in refractory ARDS, but no good trial c/w protocolized, low-
VT ARDS ventilation (Ann Surg 2004;240:595; Chest 1997;112:759; Lancet 2009;374:1351)
Esoph manometry: adjust PEEP according to esoph pressure (pleural pressure) to
maintain positive transpulm pressure S c PaO2/FiO2, c compliance and possible
outcome benefit (NEJM 2008;359:2095)
Prognosis
• Mortality: 40% overall in clinical trials; 9–15% resp. causes, 85–91% extrapulm (MODS)
• Survivors: PFTs normal, T DLCO, muscle wasting, weakness persists (NEJM 2003;348:683)

Sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate fluid 
resuscitation, along with signs of hypoperfusion
(Chest 1992;101;1644)
Fluids & Vasoactive Drugs
• Early goal-directed therapy (“Rivers Protocol”, NEJM 2001;345:1368)
Insert arterial & central venous lines (NEJM 2007;356:e21; PAC not needed) and ✓MAP,
CVP, & central venous (no need for mixed venous) O2 sat
Target MAP 65 mm Hg, CVP 8–12 mm Hg, & UOP 0.5 mL/kg/h using fluid (eg,
500 mL NS q30min) and vasopressors as needed
Target ScvO2 70% using PRBCs & inotropes (dobutamine, c dose as needed q15min)
When done w/in first 6 h for severe sepsis & septic shock, 42% T mortality
• Normal saline as good as albumin for resuscitation (NEJM 2004;350:2247)
• Norepinephrine preferred to dopamine (T arrhythmias & trend T mort.; NEJM 2010;362:779)
• Vasopressin added to low-dose norepinephrine not superior to high-dose norepineph-
rine (NEJM 2008;358:877); consider if HoTN refractory to catecholamine vasopressors
• Use PRBC w/ caution, may c mortality/morbidity, c risk of ARDS (Crit Care Med
2005;33:1191); ∴goal Hb 7 unless active cardiac ischemia (NEJM 1999;340:409)
• After early resuscitation, if ALI/ARDS, target CVP 4–6 mm Hg as additional fluids
may be harmful S c ventilator/ICU days (NEJM 2006;354:2564; Chest 2008;133:252)
• Pulse pressure variation 13% with respiration S likely volume-responsive (Chest
2008;133:252); only validated in passive, intubated Pts
Antibiotics
• If possible, obtain 2 sets of BCx before starting abx
• Start empiric IV abx w/in 1 h of recognition of severe sepsis or septic shock
• Typically want broad gram-positive and gram-negative coverage, including MRSA and
highly resistant gram-negative bacilli  anaerobes
Steroids (NEJM 2003;348:727; JAMA 2009;301:2362)
• ACTH stimulation test helps predict mortality in sepsis, does not predict benefit
from corticosteroid therapy (JAMA 2000;283:1038; NEJM 2008;358:111)
• Earlier study showed possible mortality benefit w/in 8 h of severe septic shock (SBP 90 for
1 h despite fluids & pressors) if post ACTH stim cortisol   9 g/dL (JAMA 2002;288:862)
• No mortality benefit to early (72 h) empiric corticosteroids in all Pts w/ septic
shock, regardless of ACTH stim; faster resolution of shock, more superinfection
(NEJM 2008;358:111)
• ? hydrocortisone 50–100 q6–8h  fludrocortisone 50 g daily in septic shock refrac-
tory to fluids & pressors, regardless of ACTH stim (Crit Care Med 2008;36:296)
Activated Protein C
• Remains controversial: 6% absolute T mort., but c bleeding (NEJM 2001;344:699); no mort.
benefit if low risk of death (APACHE 25 or single organ failure, NEJM 2005;353:1332)
• ? if APACHE 25 or multi-organ failure w/o contraindic. (Crit Care Med 2008;36:296)
Intensive Glycemic Control
• No evidence of improved outcomes in MICU population w/ intensive glycemic control
• Intensive glycemic control to goal 80–110 mg/dL in surgical ICU population S
mortality benefit, greatest if 3-d ICU stay (NEJM 2001;345:1359)
• More recently, intensive glycemic control S either no  or c increased mortality, and
definite c hypoglycemia (JAMA 2008;300:933; NEJM 2006;354:449; 2008;358:125; 2009;360:1283)

Treatment Options
Varices
Pharmacologic
(Hep 2007;46:922;
octreotide 50 g IVB S 50 g/h infusion (84% success). Usually 
NEJM 2010;362:823)
	 5 d, but most benefit w/in 24–48 h.
Abx: cirrhotics w/ any GIB should receive prophylaxis: Cftx IV vs.
norfloxacin PO (Hep 2004;39:746 & Gastro 2006;131;1049)
Nonpharmacologic
endoscopic band ligation (90% success)
arteriography with coiling/glue occasionally for gastric varices
balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore) if bleeding severe;
mainly used as rescue procedure and bridge to TIPS 
TIPS for esophageal variceal hemorrhage refractory to above, or
for gastric varices; c/b encephalopathy, shunt occlusion
surgery (portocaval/splenorenal shunts) rarely used now
PUD
If active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel (NBVV) on EGD

w/o ET vs. 15–20% w/ ET vs. 7% w/ ET PPI (most w/in 48 h)
Clear liquids 6 h after ET if hemodynamically stable
Arteriography w/ vasopressin or embolization; surgery (last resort)

Definition and Pathobiology (Lancet 2004;363:631)
• Acquired herniations of colonic mucosa and submucosa through the colonic wall 
• May be a consequence of low-fiber diet S c stool transit time and T stool volume S
c intraluminal pressure S herniation at site of relative muscle weakness where
vasa recta penetrate to supply blood to colonic mucosa and submucosa
Epidemiology 
• Prevalence higher w/ c age (10% if 40 y; 50–66% if 80 y);“Westernized” societies 
• Left side (90%, mostly sigmoid)  right side of colon (except in Asia, where RL)
Clinical manifestations
• Usually asx, but 5–15% develop diverticular hemorrhage and 10–25% diverticulitis 
• Nuts/seeds/popcorn intake in asx diverticulosis does not c risk of 1st case of diverticulitis
or diverticular bleeding (JAMA 2008;300:907)
DIVERTICULITIS
Pathophysiology (NEJM 2007;357:2057)
• Retention of undigested food and bacteria in diverticulum S fecalith formation S
obstruction S compromise of diverticulum’s blood supply, infection, perforation
• Uncomplicated: microperforation S localized infection
• Complicated (25%): macroperforation S abscess, peritonitis, fistula (65% w/ bladder),
obstruction, stricture
Clinical manifestations

PO abx: (MNZ  FQ) or amox/clav for 7–10 d; liquid diet until clinical improvement
• Severe: inPt Rx if cannot take POs, narcotics needed for pain, or complications
NPO, IV fluids, NGT (if ileus)
IV abx (GNR & anaerobic coverage): amp/gent/MNZ or piperacillin-tazobactam
• Abscesses 4 cm should be drained percutaneously or surgically
• Surgery: if progression despite med Rx, undrainable abcess, free perforation, or
recurrent disease (2 severe episodes)
• Colonic stricture: late complication of diverticulitis; Rx w/ endoscopic dilation vs. resection
Prevention
• Low-fiber diet immediately after acute episode; high-fiber diet when 6 wks w/o sx
• Consider mesalamine  rifaximin if multiple episodes
• Risk of recurrence 10–30% w/in 10 y of 1st episode; more likely 2nd episode complicated
DIVERTICULAR HEMORRHAGE (also see “Gastrointestinal Bleeding”)
Pathophysiology
• Intimal thickening and medial thinning of vasa recta as it courses over dome of diver-
ticulum S weakening of vascular wall S arterial rupture
• Diverticula more common in left colon; but bleeding diverticula more often in right colon
Clinical manifestations
• Painless hematochezia/BRBPR, but can have abdominal cramping
• Usually stops spontaneously (75%) but resolution may occur over hrs–days; 20% recur
Diagnostic studies
• Colonoscopy: rapid prep w/ Go-Lytely via NGT (4–6 L over 2–4 h)

• Extracolonic as in UC 
Diagnosis
• EGD/Colonoscopy  small bowel imaging (eg, video capsule endoscopy or CT
enterography); CD can affect any portion of GI tract with skip lesions
• Classify by location: small bowel (47%), ileocolonic (21%), colonic (28%); upper tract rare
• Appearance: nonfriable mucosa, cobblestoning, aphthous ulcers, deep & long fissures 
• Microscopy: transmural inflammation with mononuclear cell infiltrate, noncaseat-
ing granulomas (seen in 25% of mucosal biopsies), fibrosis, ulcers, fissures
Complications
• Perianal disease: fissures, fistulas, perirectal abscesses (up to 30% of Pts)
• Stricture: small bowel, postprandial abd pain; can lead to complete SBO
• Fistulas: perianal, enteroenteric, rectovaginal, enterovesicular, enterocutaneous
• Abscess: fever, tender abd mass, c WBC; steroids mask sx, ∴need high-level suspicion
• Malabsorption: illeal disease/resection: T bile acids abs S gallstones; T fatty acid abs S
Ca oxalate kidney stones; T fat soluble vitamin abs SVit D deficiency S osteopenia
Prognosis
• Highly variable: 1 y following dx, 55–65% in remission, 10–30% have flared, 15–25%
have low activity, and 13–20% have chronic active course 
• At 20 y, majority will have required some surgery; overall life expectancy is slightly T

MANAGEMENT (Lancet 2007;369:1641 & Gastro 2007;133:1670)
Initial Evaluation 
• H&P (✓for intestinal & extraintestinal manifestations) and endoscopy as above
• Laboratory: ESR, CRP, CBC, LFTs, Fe, B12, folate, Vit D. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Abs (ASCA) for CD & p-ANCA for UC have low Se, higher Sp; ∴not dx.
• Exclude other etiologies: infectious/ischemic colitis, med adverse effect, intestinal 
lymphoma/carcinoma, colon cancer, IBS, vasculitis, Behcet’s, sprue, bacterial overgrowth
• Rule out infection before treating with immunosuppressants and biologics
Goals of Treatment 
• Avoid NSAIDs (both UC and CD)
• Induce remission of acute flare S maintain remission; mucosal healing 1 goal
• Convention has been step-up Rx (least S most toxic). Recent shift to early and/or combined
immunomodulation to improve disease outcome (Lancet 2008;371:660 & NEJM 2010;362:1383).
Induction of Remission (Acute Flare Treatment)
Ulcerative Colitis
5-ASA
For mild dis. (4 BMs/d w/o systemic toxicity). PR if disease distal to splenic 
flexure. PO if more extensive: 2.4–4.8 g/d mesalamine (released in 
ileum/colon), olsalazine (colon), sulfasalazine (avoid if sulfa allergy).
Steroids
Mod dis. (6 BMs/d w/ minimal systemic tox) S PO prednisone. Severe dis.
(6 BMs/d w/ systemic tox) S IV. PR only in mild distal dis.
Anti-TNF
Mod/Severe flare unresponsive to steroids, flare on immunomodulators.
Infliximab: 20% remission by 30 wks (NEJM 2005;353:2462) 
CsA
Severe flare: 2 mg/kg infusion 	 24 h; ✓Mg; avoid if low chol (seizures)
Surgery
J pouch anal anastamosis; 6% fail; pouchitis: Rx w/ abx, probiotics
Crohn’s Disease
Abx
FQ/MNZ or amox/clav; best for perianal disease, limited data for colonic CD
Steroids
Mild dis. (tolerating POs, w/o 10% wt loss): consider budesonide w/ ileal dis.
(1st-pass metabolism limits systemic adverse effects)
Mod dis. (wt loss, abd pain, nausea, anemia): PO prednisone
Severe dis. (fever, obstruction, cachexia): IV pred 1 mg/kg
w/o immunomod at 1 y 30% remission, 30% steroid-depend, 40% surgery
Anti-TNF
Indic as above for UC, though early Rx prior to steroid failure gaining favor.
Infliximab (chimeric), adalimumab (humanized), or certolizumab (pegylated).
Inflixi  AZA S 60% steroid-free clin remission by 6 mos (NEJM 2010;362:1383).
Other
Surgery: diverting ileostomy, especially good for perineal disease
anti-41 integrin (natalizumab): rare risk of PML, restricted use in CD
In clinical trials: anti-IL12/23 (ustekinamab), anti-47 integrin (vedolizumab)
Maintenance of Remission (Chronic Treatment)
Ulcerative Colitis
5-ASA
Effective in maintaining remission in mild/mod UC
6MP/AZA
Takes 2–4 mos before treatment response
Anti-TNF
Infliximab: T colectomy rates & c mucosal healing
Crohn’s Disease
6MP/AZA
As above w/ UC; also effective for maintenance in Pts w/ fistulae
Anti-TNF
T surg, T hosp, cmucosal healing; 30% remission at 1 y 
If flare on infliximab: c dose, c freq, or  to adalimumab (Annals 2007;146:829)
MTX
15–25 mg IM/SC or PO qwk; 1–2 mos to take effect (NEJM 2000;342:1627)
Complications of therapy (Clin Gastro Hep 2009:7:874)
• Anti-TNF: reactivation TB; must doc  PPD prior to Rx. If c LFTs, must exclude viral
hepatitis. Small c’d risk of NHL. Other: infusion rxn; lupus-like rxn, psoriasis, MS, CHF.
• 6MP/AZA: BM suppression, lymphoma, pancreatitis, hepatitis; ✓TPMT genotype
prior to dosing to T risk of generation of toxic metabolites 
• 5-ASA: diarrhea, abd pain, pancreatitis
Cancer screening (Gastro 2010;138:738)
• Colon cancer: risk in UC 2% at 10 y, 8% at 20 y, 18% at 30 y. Similar for colonic
CD, except risk of small bowel cancer as well. Dysplasia best marker for risk. Other
risk factors include: PSC,  FHx, greater extent of disease, stricture, & pseudopolyps.
• Surveillance: colonoscopy with random bxs 8 y after dx to eval for dysplasia, q1–3y
thereafter based on risk factors. If high-grade dysplasia or dysplasia assoc. lesion/mass
S colectomy. Chemoprophylaxis: 5-ASA & ursodeoxycholic acid (if PSC) beneficial.

INTEST ISCHEM
3-12
INTESTINAL ISCHEMIA
ACUTE MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA (25%)
Etiologies
• SMA embolism (50%): from LA (AF), LV (T EF), or valves; SMA most prone to embolism
• Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (25%): transient intestinal hypoperfusion due to
T CO, atherosclerosis, sepsis, drugs that T gut perfusion (pressors, cocaine, dig, diuretic)
• SMA thrombosis (10%): usually at site of atherosclerosis, often at origin of artery
• Venous thrombosis (10%): hypercoagulable states, portal hypertension, IBD,
malignancy, inflammation (pancreatitis, peritonitis), pregnancy, trauma, surgery
• Focal segmental ischemia of the small bowel (5%): vascular occlusion to small
segments of the small bowel (vasculitis, atheromatous emboli, strangulated hernias, XRT)
Clinical manifestations
• Occlusive: sudden abd pain out of proportion to abdominal tenderness on exam
at least initially (2–4 h) until severe ischemia S frank infarction w/ peritoneal signs 
• Nonocclusive: abd distension & pain, though up to 25% may be pain-free,  N/V;
often in setting of CHF  h/o chronic mesenteric ischemia sx
• Hematochezia due to mucosal sloughing (right colon supplied by SMA)
• “Intestinal angina”: postprandial abd pain, early satiety, & T wt from gastric vascular “steal”;
may occur wks to mos before onset of acute pain in pts w/ chronic mesenteric ischemia
Physical exam
• May be unremarkable, or may only show abdominal distention;  FOBT 75% of Pts
• Bowel infarction suggested by peritoneal signs (diffuse tenderness, rebound, guarding)
Diagnostic studies
• Dx relies on high level of suspicion; rapid dx essential to avoid infarction (occurs w/in h)
• Laboratory: often nl; 75% c WBC; c amylase & LDH; 50% acidosis w/ c lactate (late)
• KUB: nl early before infarct;“thumbprinting,” ileus, pneumatosis in later stages
• CT angiogram (arterial phase imaging): non-invasive test of choice; can detect
thrombi in mesenteric vessels, colonic dilatation, bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis/
portal venous gas; venous phase imaging for dx of mesenteric vein thrombosis
• Angiography: gold standard; potentially therapeutic; indicated if suspect occlusion
Treatment
• Fluid resuscitation, optimize hemodynamics (minimize pressors); broad-spectrum abx
• Emergent surgery for prompt resection of necrotic bowel if evidence of peritonitis
• Anticoagulation for arterial & venous thrombosis and embolic disease
• Papaverine (vasodilator) catheter-directed infusion into SMA, typically in nonocclu-
sive ischemia when spasm is considered the primary cause of the ischemia
• SMA embolism: consider fibrinolytics; if no quick improvement S surgical
embolectomy if possible, o/w aortomesenteric bypass
• SMA thrombosis: percutaneous or surgical revascularization (J Vasc Surg 2009;50:341)
• Nonocclusive: correct underlying cause (especially cardiac)
• Consider angioplasty/stent vs. surg revasc in cases of chronic mesenteric ischemia if:

2 vessels or occl SMA, supportive clinical hx, & other etiologies for abd pain excluded
Prognosis
• Mortality 20 to 70% if bowel infarcted; dx prior to infarction strongest predictor of survival
ISCHEMIC COLITIS (75%)
Definition and pathophysiology
• Non-occlusive disease 2 to s in systemic circulation or anatomic/fxnal s in local
mesenteric vasculature; often underlying etiology unknown, frequently seen in elderly 
• “Watershed” areas (splenic flexure & recto-sigmoid) most susceptible, 25% involve R side
Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment
• Disease spectrum: reversible colopathy (35%), transient colitis (15%), chronic ulcerating
colitis (20%), stricture (10%), gangrene (15%), fulminant colitis (5%)
• Usually p/w cramping LLQ pain w/  FOBT or overtly bloody stool; fever
and peritoneal signs should raise clinical suspicion for infarction
• Dx: r/o infectious colitis; consider flexible sig/colonoscopy if sx persist and no alternative
etiology identified (only if peritonitis not present, o/w avoid overdistension of colon)
• Treatment: bowel rest, IV fluids, broad-spectrum abx, serial abd exams; surgery for
infarction, fulminant colitis, hemorrhage, failure of medical Rx, recurrent sepsis, stricture
• Resolution w/in 48 h w/ conservative measures occurs in 50% of cases

PANCREATITIS
Pathogenesis
• Acinar injury via direct or indirect toxicity S release or impaired secretion (ie, duct
obstruction) of enzymes S autodigestion S fat necrosis
• Profound acute inflammatory response
Etiologies
• Gallstones (40%): , usually small stones (5 mm) are culprit, also microlithiasis
• Alcohol (30%): , usually chronic, w/ acute flares
• Drugs (occur via hypersensitivity, toxic metab, or direct toxicity): furosemide, thiazides,
sulfa, DDI, asparaginase, estrogen, 6-MP/AZA,ACEI, dapsone, 5-ASA, valproic acid 
• Obstructive: panc/ampullary tumors, mets (breast, lung), annular pancreas, divisum w/
concurrent minor papilla stenosis, and ascaris 
• Metabolic: hypertriglyceridemia (TG need to be 1000 and usually 4500; seen w/
type I and type V familial hypertriglyceridemia), hypercalcemia
• Infections: coxsackie, mumps, EBV, CMV, HAV, HBV, mycoplasma,TB, candida/toxo/crypto
• Autoimmune: can p/w chronic disease or panc mass; c IgG4,  ANA, duct abnl
• Ischemia: vasculitis, cholesterol emboli, hypovolemic shock, cardiopulmonary bypass
• Post ERCP: 5% w/ clinical, overt pancreatitis; 35–70% with asx c amylase
• Post trauma: blunt abd trauma, pancreatic/biliary surgery
• Familial: autosomal dominant w/ variable penetrance (PRSS1, CFTR, SPINK1 genes)
• Scorpion sting (in Trinidad): mechanism believed to be hyperstimulation of pancreas
Clinical manifestations
• Epigastric abdominal pain, radiating to back, constant, some relief w/ leaning forward
• Nausea and vomiting
• Ddx: acute cholecystitis, perforated viscus such as DU, intestinal obstruction, mesen-
teric ischemia, IMI,AAA leak, distal aortic dissection, ruptured ectopic pregnancy
Physical exam
• Abdominal tenderness and guarding, T bowel sounds (adynamic ileus) 
 palpable abdominal mass;  jaundice if biliary obstruction
• Signs of retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Cullen’s  periumbilical; Grey Turner’s  flank) rare
• Fever, tachycardia, hypotension  shock
Diagnostic studies (Gastro 2007;132:2022)
• Laboratory
c amylase: levels 3 	 ULN suggestive of pancreatitis; level Z severity
false : acute on chronic (eg, alcoholic); hypertriglyceridemia (T amylase activity)
false : other abd or salivary gland process, acidemia, renal failure, macroamylasemia 
(amylase binds to other proteins in serum, cannot be filtered out)
c lipase: more specific than amylase
false : renal failure, other abd process, diabetic ketoacidosis, HIV, macrolipasemia
ALT 3 	 ULN suggests gallstone pancreatitis (Am J Gastro 1994;89:1863); A, bili not helpful
Other labs (see Prognosis): c WBC, c or T Hct, c BUN, T Ca, c glc
• Imaging studies
KUB/CXR: can see “sentinel loop” air in small bowel in LUQ, atelectasis, effusion
Abd CT: not required for dx, but test of choice to make dx. Helps exclude other
dx, stage severity, & r/o complications. CT w/ IV contrast on day 3 of presenta-
tion in severe cases to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis (avoid on presentation
b/c theoretical concern of c necrosis w/ IV contrast; defer if concomitant ARF).
Abd U/S: typically not useful to visualize pancreas (obscured by bowel gas), but help-
ful to investigate biliary etiology, ie, gallstones and BD dilatation; can see pseudocyst
MRI/MRCP: can detect necrosis; also used to assess for stones & ductal disruption
Endoscopic U/S (EUS):limited role acutely;useful for occult biliary disease (microlithiasis)
Treatment (Lancet 2008;371:143)
• Supportive therapy: in mild cases, bowel rest is usually sufficient
Fluid resuscitation (may need up to 10 L/d if hemodynamically severe pancreatitis)
Nutrition: enteral preferred over TPN if NPO 7 d; T infectious complications &
disease severity, & trend toward T mortality (BMJ 2004;328:1407). Ideally NJ tube, but NG okay.
Analgesia: IV meperidine, morphine (theoretical risk of sphincter of Oddi spasm,
but has not been shown to adversely affect outcome), hydromorphone
• Prophylactic systemic abx (eg, imipenem) to T mortality & prevent conversion of
sterile necrosis to infected necrosis remains controversial (Am J Surg 2009;197:806 &
Gastro 2007; 132:2022); ? reserve for severe pancreatitis w/ 30% necrosis by CT, & no
more than 14 d
• Surgery: infected necrosis (qv) nearly always requires debridement. Improved outcomes by
delaying (if possible) surgery 
2 wks to allow organization of necrosis. Cholecystectomy
if gallstones (w/in 48 h if mild, o/w w/in 14 d; Surg 2009;145:260; Ann Surg 2010;251:615)

• ERCP  sphincterotomy: in acute setting, reserved for severe cholangitis/sepsis and T
bili 5 (ie., presumptive obstructive BD stone). Otherwise, early ERCP does not
reduce risk of local or systemic pancreatitis complications (Ann Surg 2007;245:10).
Complications
• Systemic: shock, ARDS, renal failure, GI hemorrhage, DIC
• Metabolic: hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia
• Acute fluid collection (30–50%): seen early, no capsule, no Rx required
• Pseudocyst (10–20%): fluid collection, persists for 4–6 wks, encapsulated
suggested by persistent pain & elevation of amylase or lipase, or mass on exam
most resolve spont.; if 6 cm or persists 6 wks  pain S endo/perc/surg drainage
• Sterile pancreatic necrosis (20%): area of nonviable pancreatic tissue
? prophylactic abx (see above); supportive measures, surgery if Pt unstable
• Infection (5% of all cases, 30% of severe): usually 2 enteric GNR
infected pancreatic necrosis: fever & c WBC not specific; ∴FNA in deteriorating Pt
w/ necrosis (small risk of seeding sterile necrosis); if gram stain/cx  S abx  evacu-
ation (percutaneously, followed by surgical debridement after 4 wks; NEJM 2010;362:1491)
pancreatic abscess: circumscribed collection of pus (usually w/o pancreatic tissue)
treat with abx  drainage (CT-guided if possible), usually seen 
4 wks into course
• Ascites or pleural effusion: occurs due to disrupted pancreatic duct; consider early ERCP
w/ stent across duct; can also occur from draining pseudocyst
Prognosis (Gastro 2007;132:2022)
• Severe pancreatitis (20%)  organ failure or local complications (necrosis, pseudocyst) 
• Scoring systems: HAPS, BISAP,APACHE II, Ranson’s criteria, CT Severity Index
HAPS: no abd tenderness or rebound on exam plus nl Hct and Cr on admission
predicts non-severe course w/ 98% accuracy (Clin Gas Hep 2009;6:702)
BISAP: 5-point scoring system on admission (BUN 25, GCS 15, SIRS, age 60,

ABNORMAL LIVER TESTS
Tests of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis
• Aminotransferases (AST,ALT): intracellular enzymes released 2 necrosis/inflammation
ALT more specific for liver than is AST (heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, RBC/WBC)
ALT  AST S viral hepatitis or fatty liver/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (pericirrhotic)
AST:ALT 2:1 S alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, NAFLD; nonhepatic source
ALT/AST 15	 ULN S etiologies of acute liver failure (ccc LDH S ischemia/toxic)
• Alkaline phosphatase (A): enzyme bound in hepatic canicular membrane
besides liver, also found in bone, intestines, kidney, and placenta
confirm liver origin with: c 5’-NT, c GGT, or A heat fractionation
c levels seen with biliary obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis (eg, hepatic infiltration)
Tests of hepatic function
• Albumin: marker for liver protein synthesis, T slowly in liver failure (t1/2 20 d)
• Prothrombin time (PT): depends on synthesis of coag factors by the liver (except FVIII);
b/c t1/2 of some of these factors (eg,V,VII) is short, c PT can occur w/in hrs of liver dysfxn
• Bilirubin: product of heme metabolism carried by albumin to liver where it must be
taken up for conjugation (to make soluble) and then excreted into bile (most sensitive
to detect parenchymal disease); either conjugated (direct) or unconjugated (indirect)
Patterns of liver injury
• Hepatocellular: cc aminotransferases,  c bilirubin or A
ccc ALT & AST (1000): severe viral hepatitis, acetaminophen, ischemia, Wilson’s, AIH

HEPATITIS
VIRAL
Hepatitis A (ssRNA; accounts for 30–45% of acute viral hepatitis)
• Transmission: fecal-oral route; contaminated food, water, shellfish; day-care ctr outbreaks
• Incubation: 2–6 wks; no chronic carrier state
• Sx: T appetite, malaise, fever, N/V, RUQ pain,  jaundice; rarely fulminant
• Diagnosis: acute hepatitis   IgM anti-HAV; past exposure   IgG anti-HAV ( IgM)
• Treatment for acute HAV supportive. Prevention: vaccinate children & Pts w/ chronic
HBV, HCV, or other chronic liver disease (2 doses at 0, 6–12 mos)
• Postexposure ppx: age 1–40 y S vaccine; age 1 or 40 y or immunosupp S Ig
Hepatitis B (dsDNA; accounts for 45% of acute viral hepatitis; Lancet 2009;373:582) 
• Transmission: blood, sexual, perinatal
• Incubation: 6 wks–6 mos (mean 12–14 wks)
• Acute infxn: 70% subclinical, 30% jaundice, 1% fulminant hepatitis (up to 60% mortality)
• Chronic infxn: 5% (adult-acquired; higher if immunosupp), 90% (perinatally acquired);
40% chronic carriers S cirrhosis; c risk of cirrhosis if HCV, HDV, or HIV coinfection
• Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: 25–40%; highest risk w/ perinatal transmission & c’d HBV
DNA; risk of HCC w/ or w/o concurrent cirrhosis. Screen w/ AFP & US vs MRI q6mo.
• Extrahepatic syndromes: PAN (1%), MPGN, arthritis, dermatitis, PMR
• Serologic and virologic tests
HBsAg: appears before sx; used to screen blood donors; persists 6 mo  chronic HBV
HBeAg: evidence of viral replication and c infectivity
IgM anti-HBc: first Ab to appear; indicates acute infection
window period  HBsAg become , anti-HBs not yet , anti-HBc only clue to infection
IgG anti-HBc: indicates previous (HBsAg ) or ongoing (HBsAg ) HBV infection
anti-HBe: indicates waning viral replication, T infectivity
anti-HBs: indicates resolution of acute disease & immunity (sole marker after vac)
HBV DNA: presence in serum correlates w/ active viral replication in liver

• Treatment for acute HBV: supportive; hospitalize for  MS or c INR (liver transplant ctr)
• Treatment for chronic HBV if: (1) HBeAg  w/ DNA 20,000 IU/mL & elevated ALT;
(2) HBeAg  w/ DNA 2,000 IU/mL & elevated ALT or liver bx demonstrates
stage 2 fibrosis (NEJM 2008;359:1486 & Hep 2009;50;661)
• PEG IFN-2a: best rate of HBeAg seroconversion at 1 y (27%), low tolerability limits use
• 1st line is entecavir or tenofovir; well-tolerated & low resistance, HBeAg sero-
conversion at 1 yr is 21%; seroconversion at 3 y for entecavir is 39%; lamivudine
15–30% resis at 1 y; telbivudine c CK & neuropathy; adefovir (add to lamivudine-
resistant Pts) nephrotoxic & resistance occurs, too
• Goal: if HBeAg  S HBeAg , anti-HBe ; if HBeAg  or ∅seroconversion S
indefinite
• If undergo liver transplant: HBIG  nucleoside analog effective in preventing reinfection
• HIV/HBV coinfection: Rx w/ 2 drugs active against both HBV & HIV (NEJM 2007;356:1445)
• If inactive carrier scheduled to receive immunosuppresion/chemotherapy S Rx
• Prevention: vaccinate high-risk Pts (3 doses 0, 1 & 6 mos)
• Postexposure (risk infxn 30%) ppx: HBIG S vaccine (if unvac. or known nonresponder)
Hepatitis C (RNA; accounts for 10–30% of acute viral hepatitis; Lancet 2008;372:321)
• Transmission: blood  sexual; 20% w/o clear precipitant
• Incubation: 1–5 mos; mean 6–7 wks
• Natural hx

hepatitis very rare; spontaneous clearance in up to 30%
chronic:up to 80% S chronic hepatitis,20–30% of whom develop cirrhosis (after 20 y)
c risk of cirrhosis in men, EtOH, HIV; HCC in 2–5% of cirrhotics/y
• Extrahepatic syndromes: cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda (blistering rash in sun-
exposed areas), MPGN, MGUS, IPF, NHL, and DM
• Serologic and virologic tests
anti-HCV (ELISA):  in 6 wks,does not  recovery or immunity;can be  after recovery
HCV RNA:  w/in 2 wks, marker of active infection
HCV RIBA: used to confirm  anti-HCV ELISA in Pts w/ undetectable HCV RNA
HCV genotype (1–4): guides duration & predicts response to Rx (genotype 2,3  1,4)
• Diagnosis: acute hepatitis   HCV RNA,  anti-HCV 
resolved hepatitis   HCV RNA,  anti-HCV
chronic hepatitis   HCV RNA,  anti-HCV
• Treatment indications (Hep 2009;49:1335)
Acute: if no spont clearance at 8–12 wks, consider PEG-IFN	-2a/b 
 12–24 wks 
Chronic:RNA ,plus bx w/ either chronic hepatitis & fibrosis stage 1 or compensated
liver disease (in genotype 2 or 3, may proceed to Rx w/o bx b/c high response rate)
• Drugs: PEG-IFN-2a  ribavirin (Gastro 2010;138:108). Goal is sustained virologic
response (SVR)  absence of viremia 24 wks after completion of Rx. PIs (telaprevir,
boceprevir) promising (NEJM 2009;360:1827 & 1839; 2010;362:1292).
• Genotypes 1 or 4: Rx 48 wks. If early vir resp (EVR) not achieved by wk 12 (ie, RNA
T 2 log) stop Rx, as EVR best predictor of lack of SVR. If partial EVR (RNA T 2
log at 12 wks & undetectable at 24 wks), consider prolonging Rx to 72 wks.
Overall SVR rate 50–60%.
• Genotypes 2 or 3: Rx 24 wks; SVR rate 80%
• Predictors of response: RNA 400k IU/mL, rapid vir resp (∅RNA at wk 4),
∅cirrhosis, , age 40 y, wt 75 kg, white/Hispanic, ∅HIV, SNPs in IL28B

• Pathogenesis: requires HBV to cause either simultaneous or superimposed infection
• Natural hx: in HBV c severity of infxn and c progression to cirrhosis; clears w/ HBV 
• Serologic/virologic tests: anti-HDV; follow HDV RNA during Rx (high relapse rate)
Hepatitis E (RNA)
• Transmission: fecal-oral; travelers to Pakistan, India, SE Asia, Africa, and Mexico
• Natural hx: acute hepatitis w/ c mortality (10–20%) if pregnant; rare chronic in transplant Pts

OTHER CAUSES OF HEPATITIS OR HEPATOTOXICITY
Alcoholic hepatitis (NEJM 2009;360:2758)
• Sxs: can range from asx hepatomegaly to decompensation w/ ascites, encephalopathy,
and death. AST & ALT usually 300–500 w/ AST:ALT 2:1, in part b/c concomitant
B6 defic (ALT can be normal); T plt, c iron sat, c’d Tbili & INR indicate severe hepatitis.
• Rx: if discriminant fxn ( 4.6 	 [PT-control]  Tb in mg/dL) 32 or encephalopathy
methylprednisolone 32 mg/d 	 4 wks S 4–6 wk taper; T death (NEJM 1992;326:507)
contraindications: GIB, chronic HBV, sepsis 
pentoxifylline 400 mg tid T mortality due to reduction in HRS (Coch 2009;4:CD007339)
• Lille model predicts nonresponse to corticosteroids & mortality, powered by Tb from
day 1S7; nonresponders have 6-mo survival of 25% (www.lillemodel.com & Hep
2007;45:1348)
Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (Clin Liv Dis 2007;11:525 & NEJM 2008;359:285)
• Normal metabolism via glucuronidation and sulfation S nontoxic metabolites
• Overdose (usually 10 g): CYP2E1 hydroxylation S reactive electrophilic species
(NAPQI) that are scavenged by glutathione until reserves exhausted S hepatotoxicity
• CYP2E1 induced by fasting and alcohol allowing for “therapeutic misadventure” in
malnourished alcoholics taking even low doses (2–6 g) of acetaminophen
• Liver dysfunction may not be apparent for 2–6 d
• Rx: NG lavage, activated charcoal if w/in 4 h. Consider early transfer to transplant ctr.
N-acetylcysteine: administer up to 72 h after ingestion, if time of ingestion
unknown, or if chronic ingestion 4 g per day
Rumack-Matthew nomogram predicts risk of hepatotoxicity from a given
serum level of acetaminophen when time of ingestion is known (see Appendix) 
Low threshold to start NAC even w/ low or undetectable serum acetaminophen levels
PO NAC (preferred): 140 mg/kg loading dose S 70 mg/kg q4h 	 17 additional doses
IV NAC: 150 mg/kg over 1h S 50 mg/kg over 4 h S 100 mg/kg over 16 h;
risk of anaphylaxis; use if unable to tolerate POs, GIB, preg, fulminant hepatic failure
Ischemic hepatitis
• “Shock liver” w/ AST & ALT 1000  cc LDH; delayed cc Tbili
• Often requires c venous pressure  T portal/arterial pressure  hypoxia
• Typically seen in hypotension, sepsis, CHF
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Gastro 2008;134:1682)
• Fatty infiltration of the liver and absence of EtOH or other cause of liver disease.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  NAFLD  inflammation  fibrosis on liver bx
• Prevalence: 20–30% of U.S. population. Risk factors: DM & metabolic syndrome
(hyperinsulinemia, obesity, c TGs), HAART, tamoxifen, amiodarone,TPN, rapid wt loss.
Variants in apolipoprotein C3 gene a/w c TG & risk of NAFLD (NEJM 2010;362:1082).
• Clinical: 80% asx,ALT AST; NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis in 1–3% of Pts w/
NAFLD and up to 25% of Pts w/ NASH
• Dx: U/S, MRI, CT suggest fatty infiltration but liver bx only way to dx NASH vs.
NAFLD
• Rx: wt loss, glycemic/lipid control; both pioglitazone and vitamin E T steatosis &
inflammation, but not fibrosis (NEJM 2010;362:1675)

• ? statin use 1 y T risk of sx gallstones & cholecystectomy ( JAMA 2009;302:2001)
Types of gallstones
• Cholesterol (90%): 2 subtypes
mixed: contain 50% cholesterol; typically smaller, multiple stones
pure: 100% cholesterol; larger, yellow, white appearance
• Pigment (10%)
Black: unconjugated bilirubin (chronic hemolysis, cirrhosis) and calcium
Brown: stasis & infection in bile ducts S bacteria deconjugate bilirubin S precipitates w/
calcium; seen w/ duodenal diverticula, biliary strictures, parasites 
Clinical manifestations
• May be asx; biliary colic in 2%/y; once sx, rate of complications 2%/y
• Biliary colic  episodic RUQ or epigastric abd pain that begins abruptly, is con-
tinuous, resolves slowly, and lasts for 30 min to 3 h;  radiation to scapula; nausea
• May be precipitated by fatty foods
• Physical exam: afebrile,  RUQ tenderness or epigastric pain
Diagnostic studies
• RUQ U/S: Se & Sp 95% for stones 5 mm; can show complications (cholecystitis);
should be performed only after fasting 
8 h to ensure distended, bile-filled gallbladder
Treatment
• Cholecystectomy (CCY), usually laparoscopic, if symptomatic
• CCY in asx Pts w/: selective mucosal GB calcification (7% risk of ca) (Surgery
2001;129:699), GB polyps 10 mm, Native American, stones 3 cm
• Ursodeoxycholic acid (rare) for cholesterol stones w/ uncomplicated biliary pain or if

• Gallbladder carcinoma (1% in U.S.)
CHOLECYSTITIS (NEJM 2008;358:2804)
Pathogenesis
• Acute cholecystitis: stone impaction in cystic duct S inflammation behind

• HIDA scan: most Se test (80–90%) for acute cholecystitis. IV inj of HIDA, which is
selectively secreted into biliary tree. In acute cholecystitis, HIDA enters BD but
not GB. 10–20% false  (cystic duct obstructed from chronic cholecystitis, lengthy
fasting, liver disease).
Treatment
• NPO, IV fluids, nasogastric tube if intractable vomiting, analgesia

• Cholecystostomy and percutaneous drainage if too sick for surgery
• Intraoperative cholangiogram or ERCP to r/o choledocholithiasis in Pts w/ jaundice,
cholangitis, or stone in BD on U/S
Complications
• Gangrenous cholecystitis: necrosis w/ risk of empyema and perforation

ACID-BASE DISTURBANCES
GENERAL
Definitions
• Acidemia S pH 7.36, alkalemia S pH 7.44
• Acidosis S process that increases [H]; alkalosis S process that decreases [H]
• Primary disorders: metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, respiratory acidosis or alkalosis
• Compensation
respiratory: hyper- or hypoventilation alters PaCO2 to counteract 1 metabolic process
renal: excretion/retention of H/HCO3 to counteract 1 respiratory process
respiratory compensation occurs in min; renal compensation takes hrs to days
compensation never fully corrects pH; if pH normal, consider mixed disorder

Treatment of severe metabolic acidoses (pH 7.2) (NEJM 1998;338:26)
• DKA: insulin & IVF;AKA: dextrose, IVF, replete K, Mg, PO4 as needed
• Lactic acidosis: treat underlying condition, avoid vasoconstrictors
• Renal failure: hemodialysis
• Methanol & ethylene glycol: early fomepizole, vit. B6 (ethylene glycol), folate
(methanol), hemodialysis (especially if late presentation) (NEJM 2009;360:2216)
• Alkali therapy: NaHCO3 (eg, 3 50-mmol amp in 1 L D5W) to get serum HCO3 8
and pH 7.2 (estimate mmol of HCO3 needed as 8-[HCO3]serum  wt  0.5)
side effects: volume overload, hypernatremia, T ICa, c PaCO2 (and ∴possibly
intracellular acidosis), overshoot; no proven benefit in lactic acidosis (Annals 1990;112:492)
METABOLIC ALKALOSIS
Pathophysiology
• Saline-responsive etiologies require initiating event and maintenance factors, whereas
saline-resistant etiologies develop from various causes
• Initiating event
loss of H from GI tract or kidneys
exogenous alkali
contraction alkalosis: diuresis S excretion of HCO3-poor fluid S extracellular fluid
“contracts” around fixed amount of HCO3 S c HCO3 concentration
posthypercapnia: respiratory acidosis S renal compensation with HCO3 retention;
rapid correction of respiratory disorder (eg, with intubation) S transient excess HCO3
• Maintenance factors
volume depletion S c proximal reabsorption of NaHCO3 and c aldosterone (see next)
hyperaldosteronism (either 1 or 2) S distal Na reabsorption in exchange for K and
H excretion (and consequent HCO3 retention)
hypokalemia S transcellular K/H exchange; intracellular acidosis in renal proximal
tubular cells promotes bicarbonate reabsorption and ammoniagenesis

SODIUM AND WATER HOMEOSTASIS
OVERVIEW
General
• Disorders of serum sodium are generally due to s in total body water, not sodium
• Hyper- or hypoosmolality S rapid water shifts S s in brain cell volume S  MS, seizures
Key hormones
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): primary hormone that regulates sodium concentration
stimuli for secretion: hyperosmolality, TT effective arterial volume (EAV)
action: insertion of aquaporin-2 channels in collecting ducts S passive water reabsorption
urine osmolality is an indirect functional assay of the ADH-renal axis
Uosm range: 60 mOsm/L (no ADH) to 1200 mOsm/L (maximal ADH)
• Aldosterone: primary hormone that regulates total body sodium (and ∴volume)
stimuli for secretion: hypovolemia (via renin and angiotensin II), hyperkalemia
action: iso-osmotic reabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium or H
HYPONATREMIA
Pathophysiology
• Excess of water relative to sodium; almost always due to c ADH
• c ADH may be appropriate (eg, hypovolemia or hypervolemia with T EAV)
• c ADH may be inappropriate (SIADH)
• Rarely, T ADH (appropriately suppressed), but kidneys unable to maintain nl [Na]serum
primary polydipsia: ingestion of massive quantities (usually 12 L/d) of free H2O
overwhelms diluting ability of kidney (normal solute load 750 mOsm/d, min Uosm
 60 mOsm/L S excrete in 12 L; if H2O ingestion exceeds this, H2O retention)
“tea & toast” and “beer potomania”: TT daily solute load, c free H2O S insufficient
solute to excrete H2O intake (eg, if only 250 mOsm/d, minimum Uosm  60
mOsm/L S excrete in 4 L; if H2O ingestion exceeds this, H2O retention)
Workup (NEJM 2000;342:1581)
• Measure plasma osmolality
Hypotonic hyponatremia most common scenario; true excess of free H2O relative to Na
Hypertonic hyponatremia: excess of another effective osmole (eg, glc, mannitol) that
draws H2O intravascularly; each 100 mg/dL c glc 100 mg/dL S T [Na] by 2.4 mEq/L
Isotonic hyponatremia: rare lab artifact from hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia
• For hypotonic hyponatremia, ✓volume status (vital signs, orthostatics, JVP, skin
turgor, mucous membranes, peripheral edema, BUN, Cr, uric acid)
• Uosm diagnostically useful in limited circumstances, because almost always 300
exceptions: Uosm 100 in 1 polydipsia & T solute intake
moreover, Uosm 300 Z SIADH; must determine if c ADH appropriate or inappropriate
however, Uosm important when deciding on treatment (see below)
• If euvolemic and c Uosm, evaluate for glucocorticoid insufficiency and hypothyroidism

Hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia (ie, TT total body Na, T TBW)
• Renal losses (UNa 20 mEq/L, FENa 1%): diuretics (espec. thiazides, as loop diuretics
T tonicity of medullary interstitium and impair urine concentrating ability), salt-
wasting nephropathy, cerebral salt wasting, mineralocorticoid deficiency
• Extrarenal losses (UNa 10 mEq/L, FENa 1%): GI losses (eg, diarrhea), third-spacing
(eg, pancreatitis), inadequate intake, insensible losses
Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia (ie, nl total body Na, c TBW)
• SIADH (eu- or mild hypervolemia, inapprop c UOsm, normal UNa, T BUN & UA)
malignancy: lung, brain, GI, GU, lymphoma, leukemia, thymoma, mesothelioma
pulmonary: pneumonia, asthma, COPD, PTX,  pressure ventilation
intracranial: trauma, stroke, hemorrhage, infxn, hydrocephalus
drugs: antipsychotics, antidepressants, chemotherapy, vasopressin, dDAVP, MDMA
miscellaneous: pain, nausea, postoperative state
• Endocrinopathies: c ADH activity seen in glucocorticoid deficiency (co-secretion of
ADH & CRH) and hypothyroidism (T CO & T GFR)
• Psychogenic polydipsia (Uosm 100, T uric acid): usually requires intake 12 L/d
• Low solute:“tea & toast”;“beer potomania”
• Reset osmostat: chronic malnutrition (T intracellular osmoles) or pregnancy (hormonal
effects) S ADH physiology reset to regulate a lower [Na]serum
Hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia (ie, c total body Na, cc TBW)
• CHF (T CO S T EAV; UNa 10 mEq/L, FENa 1%)
• Cirrhosis (splanchnic arterial vasodilation and ascites S T EAV; UNa 10 mEq/L,
FENa 1%)
• Nephrotic syndrome (hypoalbuminemia S edema S T EAV; UNa 10 mEq/L,
FENa 1%)
• Advanced renal failure (diminished ability to excrete free H2O; UNa 20 mEq/L)
Treatment
• Goals of treatment
Asymptomatic hyponatremia: correct [Na]serum at rate of 0.5 mEq/L/h
Symptomatic hyponatremia: initial rapid correction of Na (2 mEq/L/h for the first 
2–3 h) until sx resolve
Rate of c Na should not exceed 10–12 mEq/L/d to avoid osmotic demyelination 
syndrome (spastic quadriplegia, dysarthria, dysphagia), espec if hypoNa chronic
• Effect of IV fluids
initial [Na]serum per L infusate 
eg, 1 L hypertonic saline (513 mEq Na) given to 70-kg man w/ [Na]  110 mEq/L
will c [Na]serum by 9.4 mEq
however, above assumes entire infusate retained without any output of Na or H2O
if Pt is euvolemic, as in SIADH, then infused Na will be excreted
eg, 1 L NS (154 mEq of Na or 308 mOsm of solute in 1 L free H2O) given to Pt with
SIADH with Uosm  616 S 308 mOsm solute excreted in 0.5 L H2O S
net gain 0.5 L H2O S T [Na]serum
∴normal saline can worsen hyponatremia 2 SIADH if Uosm  infusateosm
• Hypovolemic hyponatremia: volume repletion with normal saline
once volume replete S stimulus for ADH removed S kidneys will excrete free H2O S
serum Na will correct rapidly
• SIADH (NEJM 2007;356:2064): free water restrict  treat underlying cause
hypertonic saline (	 loop diuretic) if sx or Na fails to c w/ free H2O restriction
1 L hypertonic saline will raise [Na]serum by 10 mEq (see above)
50 mL/h will c [Na] by 0.5 mEq/L/h; 100–200 mL/h will c [Na] by 1–2 mEq/L/h
formula only provides estimate; ∴recheck serum Na frequently
salt tabs: particularly if chronic and no CHF
aquaresis: conivaptan (IV V1a & V2 vasopressin receptor antag) or tolvaptan (oral V2
antag); used for symptomatic SIADH resistant to above Rx
demeclocycline: causes nephrogenic DI, T Uosm
• Hypervolemic hyponatremia: free water restrict
mobilize excess Na & H2O (loop diuretics) & c EAV (vasodilators to c CO in CHF,
colloid infusion in cirrhosis)
aquaresis: tolvaptan (NEJM 2006;355:2099), consider in symptomatic hyponatremia

HYPERNATREMIA
Pathophysiology (NEJM 2000;342:1493)
• Deficit of water relative to sodium; by definition, all hypernatremic Pts are hypertonic 
• Usually loss of hypotonic fluid; occasionally infusion of hypertonic fluid
• And impaired access to free water (eg, intubation,  MS, elderly): hypernatremia

Extrarenal H2O loss (Uosm 700–800)
• GI H2O loss: vomiting, NGT drainage, osmotic diarrhea, fistula
• Insensible loss: fever, exercise, ventilation 
Renal H2O loss (Uosm 700–800)
• Diuresis: osmotic (glc, mannitol, urea), loop diuretics
• Diabetes insipidus:ADH deficiency (central) or resistance (nephrogenic)
Central: hypothalamic or posterior pituitary disease (congenital, trauma/surgery,
tumors, infiltrative); also idiopathic, hypoxic encephalopathy, anorexia, EtOH
Nephrogenic (Annals 2006;144:186)
congenital (ADH receptor V2 mutation, aquaporin-2 mutation)
drugs: Li, amphotericin, demeclocycline, foscarnet, cidofovir
metabolic: hypercalcemia, severe hypokalemia, protein malnutrition, congenital
tubulointerstitial: postobstruction, recovery phase of ATN, PKD, sickle cell,
Sjögren’s, amyloid, pregnancy (placental vasopressinase)
DI usually presents as severe polyuria and mild hypernatremia
Other (Uosm 700–800)
• Na overload: hypertonic saline (eg, resuscitation w/ NaHCO3), mineralocorticoid excess
• Seizures, cexercise: c intracellular osmoles S H2O shifts S transient c [Na]serum
Treatment
• Restore access to H2O or supply daily requirement of H2O (1 L/d)
• Replace free H2O deficit (also replace concurrent volume deficit if appropriate):

• Consider transplant evaluation
DIURESIS
General considerations 
• Increases Na excretion for treatment of HTN or edema in CHF, renal failure and cirrhosis 
• Daily wt most effective method of documenting successful diuresis
Loop diuretics (NEJM 1998;339:387)
• Drugs: furosemide (Lasix), torsemide, bumetanide (Bumex), ethacrynic acid
• Mechanism: inhibit Na-K-2Cl transporter in thick ascending limb (ThAL)
Response is fxn of amt of drug excreted; ∴c dose needed in renal insufficiency, CHF
Sigmoidal dose response curve; ∴c dose until induce diuresis, cc dose beyond that
point yields diminishing returns compared with c frequency of dosing.
• Dosing: PO bioavailability of furosemide 50%, ∴IV dose 2 as potent as PO dose
torsemide & bumetanide 90% bioavailability; use ethacrynic acid if sulfa allergy
40 mg furosemide PO ≈20 mg furosemide IV ≈20 mg torsemide PO ≈1 mg bumetanide
dose furosemide bid-qid; qd dosing can lead to initial diuresis S antinatriuresis
? c diuresis w/ contin. infusion (bolus S titrate drip) vs. bolus alone (Annals 1991;115:360)
? c diuresis w/ co-administration of albumin if T serum albumin (Crit Care Med 2005;33:1681)
Thiazide diuretics (NEJM 2009;361:2153)
• Drugs: hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorothiazide (Diuril), metolazone (Zaroxolyn)
• Mechanism: inhibit Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
synergistic with loop diuretic, esp. if chronic loop use
T effect when GFR 30, except metolazone which is still effective in renal insufficiency
• Dosing: give prior to loop diuretic, typically 30 min before 
K-sparing diuretics
• Drugs: spironolactone (Aldactone), amiloride, triamterene, eplerenone
• Mechanism: T Na reabsorption in collecting duct (amiloride/triamterene inhibit principal
cell Na channel [ENaC]; spironolactone/eplerenone inhibit mineralocorticoid receptor).
Relatively weak natriuretic activity, useful in combination with thiazide or in cirrhosis.
Approach to Diuresis (if inadequate diuresis, go to next step)
Step
Action
1
Loop diuretic PO: ✓response at 3 h, redose at 2 prior dose if needed
2
Add thiazide diuretic PO (potentiates response to loop diuretic)
3
Loop diuretic IV: bolus bid-qid 	 thiazide (may start here if inPt)
c dose needed w/ c Cr; initial effective IV lasix dose ≈30  Cr
(ie, if Cr  4 S 120 mg IV lasix)
4
Loop diuretic infusion: bolus  continuous IV infusion 	 thiazide
5
RRT: consider ultrafiltration, CVVH, or HD
Disease state specific regimens
• Renal insufficiency: loop diuretic (c dose to achieve effective delivery to ThAL) 	 thiazide
• CHF: loop diuretic (c frequency over c dose)  thiazide (watch K & Mg)

DIALYSIS
General
• Substitutes for renal solute and fluid removal 
• Acute: CVVH vs. HD (Chest 2007;132:1379); Chronic: PD vs. HD
Hemodialysis (HD) (NEJM 1998;338:1428; 339:1054)
• Physiology: blood flows along one side of semipermeable membrane, dialysate along other
Fluid removal (ie, Na  H2O) via transmembrane pressure (TMP) gradient
Solute removal via transmembrane concentration gradient and inversely proportional
to size (∴effective removal of K, urea, and Cr, but not PO4)
• Typical orders: duration, volume removal goals, K and Ca in dialysate bath, anticoagulation
• Complications: hypotension, arrhythmia, access complications, disequilibrium syndrome
Vascular Access
Advantages
Disadvantages
AV Fistula
Highest patency
Long maturation time (2–6 mo)
Lowest risk of bacteremia
Primary nonfunction (20%)
AV Graft
Easier to create than AVF
Poor 1 patency, often requiring
Maturation time (2–3 wks)
thrombectomy or angioplasty
Catheter
Immediate use
Highest risk of bacteremia
Use as bridge to AVF/AVG
T blood flow S T HD efficiency
Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) (NEJM 1997;336:1303)
• Physiology: based on hemofiltration rather than dialysis. Blood under pressure passes
down one side of a highly permeable membrane allowing water and solutes to pass
across the membrane via TMP gradient (convective clearance). Filtrate is discarded.
Replacement fluid is infused (solute concentrations similar to plasma, except no K,
urea, Cr, PO4). Fluid balance precisely controlled by adjusting amounts of filtrate
and replacement fluid.
• Access: double-lumen central venous catheter
• Typical orders: volume removal goals, replacement fluid buffer: HCO3 (requires heparin 
to prevent machine from clotting) vs. citrate (hepatically metabolized to HCO3;
provides anticoagulation w/ in machine via Ca chelation; ∴need Ca infusion to
maintain serum Ca)
• Complications: hypotension, T PO4, access complications; T ICa (citrate toxicity in Pts
with hepatic dysfunction S look for T ICa but normal/ c serum Ca and AG meta-
bolic acidosis)
• Potential advantages over HD: less hypotension, better volume control, removal of
inflammatory mediators; however, no survival advantage (Lancet 2006;368:379)
• No advantage for high intensity CVVH over standard intensity (NEJM 2008;359:7)
Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) (Perit Dial Int 2001;21:25)
• Physiology: peritoneum acts as membrane. Fluid balance controlled by choosing
dialysate glucose concentration (higher concentrations pull more fluid into peri-
toneum); longer dwell times pull less fluid as glucose equilibrates across peritoneum
• Access: permanent catheter inserted in OR
• Typical orders for CAPD (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis):
PD fluid  1.5%, 2.5%, or 4.25% dextrose
buffer (lactate), Na, K, Ca2, Mg2
infuse 10 min, dwell 30 min–5.5 h, drain 20 min
• Can use overnight cycler device that infuses & drains more rapidly, with shorter dwells,
while Pt sleeps. Called automated or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (APD, CCPD).
• Complications
Peritonitis (abdominal pain, tenderness, cloudy drainage)
diagnosis:WBC 100 and 50% PMNs
spectrum: 60–70% GPC, 15–20% GNR, remainder no bacteria or fungal
Rx: abx IV or in PD, catheter removal for certain pathogens (eg, yeast, Pseudomonas)
Hyperglycemia: exacerbated by inflammation, long dwell times, and higher [glc]
T albumin; right-sided pleural effusion

Urine characteristics: c Ca, c oxalate, c urate, c pH, T citrate, T volume
2 hypercalciuria: 1 hyperparathyroidism, type 1 RTA, sarcoid
2 hyperoxaluria: Crohn’s, ileal disease w/ intact colon, gastric bypass
Diet: c animal protein, c sucrose, c Na, T K, T fluid, T fruits/vegetables
• Uric acid: 5–10% of kidney stones, radiolucent on plain film
Urine characteristics: c uric acid (eg, gout), T pH (eg, from chronic diarrhea)
• Magnesium ammonium phosphate (“struvite” or “triple phosphate”)
Chronic UTI w urea-splitting organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebs) S c urine NH3 and pH (7)
• Cystine: inherited defects of tubular amino acid reabsorption
Clinical manifestations
• Hematuria (absence does not exclude diagnosis), flank pain, N/V, dysuria, frequency
• Ureteral obstruction (stones 5 mm unlikely to pass spont.) S AKI if solitary kidney
• UTI: c risk of infection proximal to stone; urinalysis of distal urine may be normal
Workup
• Noncontrast helical CT scan (ureteral dilation w/o stone suggests recent passage) 
• Strain urine for stone to analyze; U/A & UCx, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, Ca, PO4, PTH, UA
• 24-h urine  2 (6 wk after acute setting) for Ca, PO4, UA, oxalate, citrate, Na, Cr
Acute treatment (NEJM 2004;350:684)
• Analgesia (narcotics 	 NSAIDs; combination superior, Ann Emerg Med 2006;48:173), aggressive
PO/IV hydration, antibiotics if UTI
• Consider CCB or alpha blocker to promote ureteral relaxation (Lancet 2006;368:1171)
• Indications for immediate urologic evaluation and/or hospitalization: obstruction
(especially solitary or transplant kidney), urosepsis, intractable pain or vomiting, AKI
• Urologic Rx: lithotripsy, cystoscopic stent, percutaneous nephrostomy, stone removal
Chronic treatment
• Increase fluid intake (2 L/d) for goal UOP 2 L/d
• Calcium stones: 24-h urine identifies specific urinary risk factors to treat
T Na and meat intake (NEJM 2002;346:77), thiazides: decrease urine Ca
Depending on 24-h urine: K-citrate, dietary oxalate restriction, allopurinol
High dietary Ca is likely beneficial by T oxalate absorp., unclear role of Ca supplements
• Uric acid: urine alkalinization (K-citrate), allopurinol
• Magnesium ammonium phosphate: antibiotics to treat UTI, urologic intervention
• Cystine: urine alkalinization (K-citrate), D-penicillamine, tiopronin, captopril

NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS
Pancytopenia (see below)
Anemia of chronic inflammation (ACI; NEJM 2005;352:1011; 2009;361:1904)
• T RBC production due to impaired iron utilization and functional iron deficiency
from c hepcidin; cytokines (IL-6,TNF-) cause T epo responsiveness/production
•  Etiologies: autoimmune disorders, chronic infection, inflammation, HIV, malignancy
• Dx: T Fe, T TIBC (usually normal or low transferrin sat), 	 c ferritin; usually
normochromic, normocytic (70% of cases) but can be microcytic if prolonged.
• Coexisting iron deficiency common. Dx clues include T serum ferritin levels, absence
of iron staining on BM bx,  response to a trial of oral iron, and/or c soluble
transferrin receptor/ferritin index (Blood 1997;89:1052).
• Treatment: treat underlying disease 	 erythropoietin (? if Epo 500 mU/mL); for
cancer- or chemo-related ACI, use epo if Hb 10 g/dL. Iron if ferritin 100 or
Fe/TIBC 20%.
Anemias of chronic disorders
• Anemia of chronic inflammation (see above)
• Anemia of chronic kidney disease: T epo; may see burr cells; treat w/ epo (see
“Chronic Kidney Disease”)
• Endocrine deficiencies: hypometabolism and T O2 demand with thyroid, pituitary, adrenal,
or parathyroid disease S T epo; can be normocytic or macrocytic
Sideroblastic anemia (see above)
Pure red cell aplasia
• Destructive antibodies or lymphocytes S ineffective erythropoiesis
• Associated with thymoma, CLL, and parvovirus infection
• Diagnostic studies: lack of erythroid precursors on BM bx, other lines normal
• Treatment: thymectomy if thymus enlarged; IVIg if parvovirus infection;
immunosuppression if CLL or idiopathic; supportive care with PRBC transfusions;
? erythropoietin receptor agonist if due to antierythropoietin Ab (NEJM 2009;361:1848)

MACROCYTIC ANEMIAS
includes megaloblastic and nonmegaloblastic causes
Megaloblastic anemia
• Impaired DNA synthesis S cytoplasm matures faster than nucleus S ineffective
erythropoiesis and macrocytosis; due to folate or B12 deficiency
• ✓folate and vitamin B12, c LDH & indirect bilirubin (due to ineffective erythropoiesis)
• Smear: neutrophil hypersegmentation, macro-ovalocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis
Folate deficiency
• Folate present in leafy green vegetables and fruit; total body stores sufficient for 2–3 mo
• Etiologies: malnutrition (alcoholics, anorectics, elderly), T absorption (sprue),
impaired metabolism (methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim), c requirement
(chronic hemolytic anemia, pregnancy, malignancy, dialysis)
• Diagnosis: T folate; T RBC folate, c homocyst. but nl methylmalonic acid (unlike B12 defic.)
• Treatment: folate 1–5 mg PO qd for 1–4 mo or until complete hematologic recovery;
critical to r/o B12 deficiency first (see below)
Vitamin B12 deficiency
• B12 present only in foods of animal origin; total body stores sufficient for 2–3 y
• Binds to intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by gastric parietal cells; absorbed in terminal ileum
• Etiologies: malnutrition (alcoholics, vegans), pernicious anemia (PA, autoimmune dis-
ease against gastric parietal cells, a/w polyglandular endocrine insufficiency and c
risk of gastric carcinoma), other causes of T absorption (gastrectomy, sprue, Crohn’s
disease), c competition (intestinal bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm)
• Clinical manifestations: neurologic changes (subacute combined degeneration)
affecting peripheral nerves, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, and cortex
S numbness, paresthesias, T vibratory and positional sense, ataxia, dementia
• Dx: T B12; c homocysteine and methylmalonic acid; anti-IF Ab; Schilling test; c gastrin in PA
• Treatment: 1 mg B12 IM qd  7 d S q wk  4–8 wk S q month for life
neurologic abnormalities are reversible if treated w/in 6 mo
folate can reverse hematologic abnormalities of B12 deficiency but not neurologic
changes (and can lead to “steal” of B12 stores S worsening of neuro complications)
oral supplementation (2 mg qd) appears feasible as well (Blood 1998;92:1191) even w/o IF
Nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias
• Liver disease: often macrocytic, may see target cells
• Alcoholism: BM suppression & macrocytosis independent of folate/B12 defic. or cirrhosis
• Reticulocytosis
• Other causes: hypothyroidism; MDS; meds that impair DNA synthesis (zidovudine,
5-FU, hydroxyurea,Ara-C); hereditary orotic aciduria; Lesch-Nyhan synd.

Tests of platelet function
• Bleeding time: global screen of platelet function; not reliable and rarely used
• Platelet aggregation tests: measure aggregation in response to agonists (eg,ADP)
von Willebrand’s disease (vWD) (NEJM 2004;351:683)
• von Willebrand’s factor (vWF) function  platelet glue & plasma carrier of factor VIII
• vWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder.
Type 1 (autosomal dominant; 85% of cases): partial quantitative deficiency in vWF
Type 2 (autosomal dominant; 15% of cases): qualitative deficiency of vWF
Type 3 (autosomal recessive; rare): near complete deficiency of vWF
• Acquired vWD: associated with many disorders (malignancy, autoimmune, hypothyroidism,
drugs) and caused by different mechanisms (anti-vWF Abs, c clearance, T synthesis)
• Diagnosis: T vWF:Ag, T vWF activity (measured by ristocetin cofactor assay), T factor
VIII, 	 c PTT, 	 T platelets; confirm with vWF multimer analysis
• Clinical condition, factor VIII levels and ristocetin cofactor assay useful to guide Rx decision
• Treatment: desmopressin (dDAVP, IV/IN) S c endothelial cell release of vWF; variable
efficacy depending on type, ∴✓response before use w/ subseq. bleeding or procedures;
vWF replacement: cryoprecipitate, factor VIII concentrates rich in vWF, recomb. vWF
Uremic Bleeding
• Uremia S platelet dysfunction including T aggregation, impaired adhesiveness
• Treatment: dDAVP, cryoprecipitate, correct anemia (improves plt aggregation and
adhesion by increasing plt interactions with endothelium),consider holding anti-plt agents

Hemophilias (NEJM 2001;344:1773)
• X-linked factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B) deficiency
• Classification: mild (5–25% normal factor activity), moderate (1–5%), or severe (1%)
• Clinical manifestations: hematomas, hemarthroses, bruising, bleeding (mucosal, GI, GU)
• Diagnosis: c PTT (normalizes w/mixing study), normal PT & vWF, T factor VIII or IX
• Treatment: purified/recomb. factor VIII or IX concentrate, desmopressin (mild disease),
aminocaproic acid; recomb. factor VIIa if factor inhib., cryo (only has factor VIII)
Coagulation factor inhibitors
• Etiologies: hemophilia (treated with factor replacement); postpartum; lymphoproliferative
disorders and other malignancies; autoimmune diseases; most commonly anti–factor VIII
• Diagnosis: c PTT (does not normalize w/mixing study); Bethesda assay quantitates titer
• Treatment: high titer S recomb. factor VIIa, porcine factor concentrates, activated
prothrombin complex; others S high-purity human factor, plasmapheresis, immuno-
supp. w/ steroids, cyclophosphamide, and/or rituximab (Curr Opin Hematol 2008;15:451)
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (NEJM 1999;341:586)
• Etiologies: trauma, shock, infection, malignancy (esp.APL), obstetric complications
• Pathogenesis: massive activation of coagulation that overwhelms control mechanisms
thrombosis in microvasculature S ischemia  microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
acute consumption of coagulation factors and platelets S bleeding
chronic DIC S able to replete factors and platelets S thrombosis
• Diagnosis: c PT, c PTT, T fibrinogen (may be nl b/c acute phase),  FDP/D-dimer, T
plts,  schisto, c LDH, T hapto; chronic DIC:  FDP/D-dimer, variable plts, other labs nl
• Treatment: treat underlying process; support with FFP, cryoprecipitate (goal fibrinogen

Ab. Also consider nephrotic syndrome, PNH (especially if mesenteric thrombus).
• Consider JAK2 mutation screen if suspect myeloprolif disorder, especially if Budd-Chiari.
• Proteins C & S and ATIII levels are affected by acute thrombosis and anticoagulation
∴levels best assessed 2 wk after completing anticoagulation course
• Age-appropriate malignancy screening ( in 12% with “idiopathic” DVT; Annals 1996;125:785)
Treatment
• Asx w/ inherited risk factor: consider prophylactic anticoag. if develops acquired risk factor
• Thrombosis w/ inherited risk factor: see “Venous Thromboembolism”
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (NEJM 2002;346:752)
• Definition: dx requires 1 clinical & 1 laboratory criteria
Clinical: thrombosis (any) or complication of pregnancy (3 spont. abortions before 
10 wk or 1 fetal loss after 10 wk or premature birth before 34 wk)
Laboratory:  moderate-high titer anticardiolipin (ACL), lupus anticoagulant (LA)
or 2-glycoprotein-I (2-GP-I) Ab on 2 occasions at least 12 wk apart
• Clinical manifestations: DVT/PE/CVA, recurrent fetal loss, thrombocytopenia,
hemolytic anemia, livedo reticularis; “catastrophic APS”  widespread acute
thrombotic microangiopathy with multiorgan visceral damage S high mortality
• Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA)
✓ if: SLE, age 40 y & arterial thromb, recurrent venous thromb, spontaneous abortion 
ACL: Ab against cardiolipin, a mitochondrial phospholipid; IgG more specific than IgM
LA: Ab that prolongs phospholipid-dependent coagulation reactions; ∴c PTT that
does not correct with mixing study but does correct with excess phospholipids
or platelets; PT not affected b/c the reaction contains much more phospholipid
2-GP-I:  Ab against 2-glycoprotein-I, IgG or IgM
False VDRL: nontreponemal test for syphilis in which cardiolipin is part of Ag complex
Clinical significance of different Abs in pathogenesis uncertain
Risk of thromboembolic phenomena may increase with titer of APLs
• Etiologies: primary (idiopathic) or secondary due to autoimmune syndromes
(eg, SLE), malignancy, infections, drug reactions
• Treatment: UFH/LMWH S warfarin after thromboembolic event (lifelong for most Pts)
Intensity of anticoagulation controversial (Arthritis Rheum 2007;57:1487)

• Acute hemolytic: fever, hypotension, flank pain, renal failure 24 h after transfusion
Due to ABO incompatibility S preformed Abs against donor RBCs
Treatment: vigorous IVF, maintain UOP with diuretics, mannitol, or dopamine
• Delayed hemolytic: generally less severe than acute hemolytic; 5–7 d after transfusion
Due to undetected allo-Abs against minor antigens S anamnestic response
Treatment: usually no specific therapy required; dx is important for future transfusion
• Febrile nonhemolytic: fever and rigors 0–6 h after transfusion
Due to Abs against donor WBCs and cytokines released from cells in blood product
Treatment: acetaminophen 	 meperidine; rule out infection and hemolysis
• Allergic: urticaria; rarely, anaphylaxis: bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, hypotension
Reaction to transfused proteins; anaphylaxis seen in IgA-deficient Pts w/ anti-IgA Abs
Treatment: urticaria S diphenhydramine; anaphylaxis S epinephrine 	 glucocorticoids
• Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI): noncardiogenic pulmonary edema
Due to donor Abs that bind recipient WBCs, which then aggregate in pulmonary
vasculature and release mediators causing c capillary permeability. Rx: see “ARDS.”

pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly) and bone marrow (10% dysplasia with blasts 	 RS) 
• Cytogenetic abnormalities: several are characteristic of MDS and have prognostic
significance [eg, del(5q), monosomy 7, del(7q), trisomy 8, del(20q)]
• Prior to dx MDS: exclude AML (20% blasts) and CMML (monocyte count 1  109/L);

MPN
5-15
MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS (MPN)
General (NEJM 2006;355:2452; Nat Rev Clin Oncol 2009;6:627)
• Results from clonal expansion of multipotent hematopoietic stem cell
• A type of myeloid neoplasm (see MDS for classification)
• Different from MDS in that the cells are not dysplastic (ie, normally developed)
• 8 categories of MPN: polycythemia vera (PV); essential thrombocythemia (ET); primary
myelofibrosis (PM); chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL1–; chronic
neutrophilic leukemia; chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified; masto-
cytosis; myeloproliferative neoplasms, unclassifiable
• Gain of fxn mutations in JAK2 (Janus kinase) present in most cases of MPN (PV 100%,
ET 50%, PMF 50%; NEJM 2005;352:1779) and BCR-ABL fusion in all cases of CML;
KIT mutations in virtually all mastocytosis; MPL and TET2 mutations w/ lower 
frequency; genetic lesions are useful as a clonal marker and dx tool
POLYCYTHEMIA VERA (PV)
Definition
• c in RBC mass 	 c granulocytes and platelets in the absence of physiologic stimulus
Etiologies of erythrocytosis
• Relative c RBC (T plasma): dehydration;“stress” erythrocytosis (Gaisböck’s syndrome)
• Absolute c RBC: 1 (PV, other MPD) or 2 due to hypoxia; carboxyhemoglobinemia;
inappropriate erythropoietin (renal, hepatic, cerebellar tumors); Cushing’s syndrome
Clinical manifestations (common between PV and ET)
• Symptoms S often termed “vasomotor symptoms”
hyperviscosity (erythrocytosis): headache, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision
thrombosis (hyperviscosity, thrombocytosis): transient visual disturbances (amaurosis,
ocular migraine); Budd-Chiari syndrome; erythromelalgia  intense burning, pain, and
erythema of extremities due to microvascular thrombi; c risk of DVT, MI, stroke.

ACUTE LEUKEMIA
Definition
• Clonal proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor with T ability to differentiate into mature
elements S c blasts in bone marrow and periphery S T RBCs, platelets, and neutrophils
Epidemiology and risk factors
• Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML): 12,000 cases/y; median age 65 y; 80% of
adult acute leukemia cases
• Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): 4000 cases/y; median age 10 y; bimodal with
2nd peak in elderly
• Risk factors: radiation, chemo (alkylating agents, topo II inhib), benzene, smoking
• Acquired hematopoietic diseases: MDS, MPN (especially CML), aplastic anemia, PNH
• Inherited: Down’s & Klinefelter’s, Fanconi’s anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia
Clinical manifestations
• Cytopenias S fatigue (anemia), infection (neutropenia), bleeding (thrombocytopenia)
• More common in AML:
leukostasis (when blast count 50,000/L): occluded microcirculation S local
hypoxemia and hemorrhage S headache, blurred vision,TIA/CVA, dyspnea, hypoxia;
look for hyperviscosity retinopathy (vascular engorgement, exudates, hemorrhage)

CNS involvement (15%): cranial neuropathies, nausea and vomiting, headache
anterior mediastinal mass (especially in T-cell); tumor lysis syndrome (qv)
Diagnostic evaluation (Blood 2009;114:937)
• Peripheral smear: anemia, thrombocytopenia, variable WBC (50% p/w c WBC,
50% p/w normal or T WBC)  circulating blasts (seen in 95%;  Auer Rods in AML)
• Bone marrow: hypercellular with 20% blasts; cytogenetics, flow cytometry
• Presence of certain cytogenetic anomalies, ie, t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or
t(16;16), are sufficient for dx of AML regardless of the blast count
• ✓for tumor lysis syndrome (rapid cell turnover): c UA, c LDH, c K, c PO4, T Ca
• Coagulation studies to r/o DIC: PT, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer
• LP (w/ co-admin of intrathecal chemotherapy to avoid seeding CSF w/ circulating
blasts) for ALL Pts (CNS is sanctuary site) and for AML w/ CNS sx
• TTE if prior cardiac history or before use of anthracyclines
• HLA typing of Pt, siblings, and parents for potential allogeneic HSCT candidates

Treatment (Blood 2009;113:1875 & 2010;115:453)
• Induction chemo followed by consolidation Rx
• Induction chemo:“3  7”  ida/daunorubicin  3 d  cytarabine  7 d; daunorubicin
high-dose (90 mg/m2) superior to standard dose (45 mg/m2) (NEJM 2009;361:1235 & 1249)
• ✓for complete remission (CR)  normal peripheral counts, 5% BM blasts
CR Z cure ∴must always f/u induction with consolidation Rx
• If  CR: consolidation Rx based on risk stratification (age, genetics, PS): chemo or
allogeneic HSCT or autologous HSCT (JAMA 2009;301:2349)
• If  CR: reinduction with similar chemotherapy (25) or alternative regimen
• If relapse after CR: salvage chemotherapy followed by allogeneic or autologous HSCT
• Supportive care: hydration  allopurinol or rasburicase for tumor lysis prophylaxis;
transfusions 	 G-CSF; antibiotics for fever and neutropenia; antifungals
for prolonged fever & neutropenia; hydroxyurea 	 leukophoresis for leukostasis
Prognosis
• CR achieved in 70–80% of Pts 60 y and in 40–50% for Pts 60 y
• Overall survival depends on prognostic factors: ranges from 50% for Pts 60 y w/o 
poor prognostic factors to 10% for Pts 60 y w/ poor prognostic factors
• Poor prognostic factors: age 60, unfavorable cytogenetics (see above), poor
performance score, antecedent MDS/MPN, therapy-related AML
• Gene expression profiling may be useful (NEJM 2004;330:1605, 1617; JCO 2005;23:6296)
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) (Blood 2009;113:1875)
• Rare disease w/ only 600–800 cases/y in US, but biologically and clinically distinct
• Atypical promyelocytes (large, granular cells; creased nuclei) in blood and bone marrow
• Defined by translocation of retinoic acid receptor: t(15;17); PML-RAR (95% of cases)
• Medical emergency with DIC and bleeding common; supportive care measures crucial
• Remarkable responses to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which induces differentiation,
and arsenic trioxide (ATO); early initiation of ATRA is critical as soon as APL suspected
• Induction chemo typically anthracycline  ATRA 	 cytarabine S CR in 90% of Pts
• Consolidation Rx (eg,ATO S anthracycline  ATRA) followed by prolonged mainte-
nance Rx (eg,ATRA  6MP  MTX); ATO highly active in induction and consolida-
tion and is promising as 1st-line Rx or for treatment of refractory disease
• Overall best prognosis of all AMLs w/ 80% cure rate; WBC 10,000/L 
is adverse prognostic factor (Blood 2000;96:1247)
ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (ALL)
Classification
• Lymphoblastic neoplasms may present as acute leukemia (ALL) with 20% BM
blasts, or as lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) w/ mass lesion & 20% BM blasts.

Prognosis
• CR achieved in 80% of adults
• Cure achieved in 50-70% if good prog. factors vs. in 10–30% w/ poor prog. factors
• Good prognostic factors: younger age,WBC 30,000/L,T-cell immunophenotype,
absence of Ph chromosome or t(4;11), early attainment of CR
• Gene expression patterns may be useful in predicting chemo resistance (NEJM 2004;351:533)
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA (CML)
Definition (Blood 2009;114:937)
• Myeloproliferative neoplasm with clonal overproduction of hematopoietic
myeloid stem cells that can differentiate
• Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) 	 t(9;22) S BCR-ABL fusion S c Abl kinase activity
BCR-ABL required for Dx of CML
• “Atypical CML” (BCR-ABL ) now considered a separate disease and reclassified as
MDS/MPN (see “Myelodysplastic Syndromes”)
Epidemiology and risk factors
• 4300 new cases/y in U.S.; median age 50 at presentation; 15% of adult leukemias
• c risk with irradiation; no clear relation to cytotoxic drugs
Clinical manifestations
• Triphasic clinical course; 85% present in the chronic phase
• Chronic phase: often asymptomatic but common features are fatigue, malaise, weight
loss, night sweats, abdominal fullness (splenomegaly 50%)
• Accelerated phase: refractory leukocytosis and worsening symptoms S fever, weight
loss, progressive splenomegaly, bone pain, bleeding, infections, pruritus (basophilia)
• Blastic phase  acute leukemia S severe constitutional symptoms, infection, bleeding
and possible leukostasis (see “Acute Leukemia”)
Diagnostic evaluation
• Peripheral smear: leukocytosis (often 100,000/L), left-shifted with all stages of
myeloid maturation; anemia, thrombocytosis, basophilia
• Bone marrow: hypercellular, c myeloid to erythroid ratio, T leuk alkaline phosphatase
• Chronic: 10% blasts (peripheral or BM)
• Accelerated: 10–20% blasts, 20% basos, plts 100K, c spleen size, karyotypic prog.
• Blastic: 20% blasts (2/3 myeloid, 1/3 lymphoid), may see extramedullary leukemia
Treatment (NEJM 2006;355:2408; Lancet 2007;370:342; NEJM 2007;357:258)
• Tyrosine kinase inhib: 1st line Rx chronic phase; continued indef in responders
imatinib, dasatinib & nilotinib are selective inhib of BCR-ABL (Blood 2008;112:4808)
imatinib active in chronic, accelerated, blastic phases (but less as disease advances)
imatinib resistance is associated with BCR-ABL mutation or amplification 
dasatanib and nilotinib are more potent BCR-ABL inhibitors and yield higher
response rates than imatinib as initial therapy (NEJM 2010:362:2251 & 2260); both are effec-
tive against most imatinib resistance mutations except T315I (NEJM 2006:354:2531 & 2542)
side effects include nausea, diarrhea, muscle cramps, cytopenias, T PO4, rarely CHF;
dasatinib also a/w pericardial & pleural effusions, nilotinib w/ c bili & lipase
• Allogeneic HSCT: consider for Pts w/ available donor who present in accelerated or
blastic phase; reasonable option for Pts with relapsed/refractory disease to imatinib
(especially Pts w/ BCR-ABL T315I mutation)

NHL: diffuse; nodal and extranodal disease with noncontiguous spread;
symptoms reflect involved sites (abdominal fullness, bone pain)
• Constitutional (“B”) symptoms: fever (38), sweats, weight loss (10% over 6 mos)
HL: periodic, recurrent “Pel-Ebstein” fever; 10–15% have pruritus
NHL: “B” symptoms less common than in HL
Diagnostic and staging evaluation
• Physical exam: lymph nodes, liver/spleen size, Waldeyer’s ring, testes (1% of NHL), skin
• Pathology: excisional lymph node bx (not FNA, need surrounding architecture) with
immunophenotyping and cytogenetics; BM bx (except in HL clinical stage IA/IIA with
favorable features); LP if CNS involvement is clinically suspected
• Lab tests: CBC, BUN/Cr, LFTs, ESR, LDH, UA, Ca, alb; ✓HBV & HCV (and must 
✓HBsAg & anti-HBc if planning rituximab Rx as can lead to HBV reactivation); 
consider HIV, HTLV, & EBV serologies and connective tissue diseases autoAbs
• Imaging: chest/abd/pelvic CT (but don’t reliably detect spleen/liver involvement)

• Types of Allo HSCT: based on donor/recipient matching of major HLA antigens on
Chr. 6 (3 principal genes for serotyping: HLA-A, -B, & -DR; each w/ 2 alleles ∴6 major Ag)
Matched related (sibling matched at 6/6 major Ag): lowest risk of GVHD; preferred donor
Mismatched related (eg, 1/6 Ag mismatch) or haploidentical (mismatch at 3/6 Ag):
easiest to find, but c risk of GVHD; ∴need to deplete T cells first
Matched unrelated: c risk of GVHD; ∴adv. molecular matching of 8 HLA alleles to T risk
Umbilical cord blood: HSC processed at birth & stored; T risk of GVHD; tolerate mismatch
• Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): undesirable side effect of allo HSCT
allogeneic T cells view host cells as foreign; c incid. w/ mismatch or unrelated donors
• Graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect: desirable consequence of allo HSCT;
allogeneic T cells attack host tumor cells
Indications (NEJM 2006;354:1813)
• Malignant disease:
Auto HSCT allows higher doses of chemo by rescuing hematopoietic system
(used for lymphoma, multiple myeloma, testicular cancer)
Allo HSCT produces graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect, in addition to
hematopoietic rescue (used for AML, ALL, CML, CLL, MDS, lymphoma)
• Nonmalignant disease: allo HSCT replaces abnl lymphohematopoietic system w/ one
from nl donor (eg, immunodef., aplastic anemia, hemoglobinopathies, ? autoimmune dis.)
Transplantation procedure
• Preparative regimen: chemotherapy and/or immunosuppression prior to transplantation
myeloablative (traditional): chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation. Goal is
eradication of underlying disease for which transplant is being performed.
nonmyeloablative (“mini”): reduced-intensity conditioning regimens S T toxicity to
allow Pts w/ comorbidities or c age to tolerate HSCT. Goal to proceed w/
transplant when in disease remission, harnessing GVT effect while tolerating GVHD.
• Sources of stem cells:
bone marrow (BM): original source of HSCT but now less common than PBSC
peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC): easier collection, most commonly used source
umbilical cord blood (UCB): less stringent HLA-matching requirements, though fewer
available cells from single donor (∴2 donors typically combined), slower engraftment
• Engraftment: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovers to 500/L w/in 2 wk w/ PBSC,
3 wk w/ BM, 4 wk w/ UCB. G-CSF accelerates recovery by 3–5 d in all scenarios.
Engraftment syndrome: fever, rash, noncardiogenic pulm edema, abnl LFTs, AKI, wt gain.
Dx of exclusion, r/o infection, GVHD; Rx w/ IV steroids.
Complications
• Either direct chemoradiotoxicites associated with preparative regimen or consequences
of interaction between donor and recipient immune systems

Mechanism: direct cytotoxic injury to hepatic venules S in situ thrombosis
Symptoms: tender hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, fluid retention
with severe disease S liver failure, encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome
Diagnosis: c ALT/AST, c bilirubin; c PT with severe disease; Doppler U/S may show
reversal of portal vein flow; c hepatic wedge pressure; abnl liver bx
Treatment: supportive; prophylaxis with ursodiol; defibrotide
• Idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (IIP, up to 70% mortality; Curr Opin Oncol 2008;20:227)
Mech: alveolar injury due to direct toxicity S fever, hypoxia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates
Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH): subset of IIP
Diagnosis: bronchoscopy to exclude infection; c bloody lavage fluid seen with DAH
Treatment: high-dose corticosteroids (limited data)
• Acute GVHD (within 3 mos of transplant; Lancet 2009;373:1550)
Clinical grade I-IV based on scores for skin (severity of maculopapular rash), liver
(bilirubin level), and GI (volume of diarrhea); bx supports diagnosis
Prevention: immunosuppression (MTX  CsA or tacrolimus) or T-cell depletion of graft
Treatment: grade I S none; grade II–IV  S associated with T survival and ∴treated with
immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, CsA, tacrolimus, rapamycin, rituximab, MMF)
• Chronic GVHD (developing or persisting beyond 3 mos posttransplant)
Clinical: malar rash, sicca syndrome, arthritis, obliterative bronchiolitis, bile duct
degeneration and cholestasis. More common w/ PBSC than BM.
Treatment: immunosuppressants as above; photopheresis
• Graft failure
Primary  persistent neutropenia without evidence of engraftment
Secondary  delayed pancytopenia after initial engraftment; either immune mediated due
to attack by immunocompetent host cells in the allogeneic setting (termed graft
rejection) or non–immune mediated (eg, CMV infection)
• Infectious complications
due to regimen-induced pancytopenia and immunosuppression
auto HSCT recipients do not require immunosuppression and ∴remain at c risk only
during the pre-engraftment and immediate postengraftment phases

Epidemiology and genetics (Risk assessment tool: www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/)
• Most common cancer in U.S. women; 2nd leading cause of cancer death in women
• Age: incidence rates c with age, with decrease in slope at age of menopause
• Genetics (NEJM 2007;357:154 & 2008;359:2143): 15–20% have  FHx. Risk depends on # of
affected 1 relatives and their age at dx. 45% of familial cases a/w known germline mut.
BRCA1/2: 35–85% lifetime risk of breast cancer & c risk of ovarian cancer; ? c colon &
prostate cancer; prog not worse than in non-carriers w/ breast cancer (NEJM
2007;357:115); BRCA2: a/w c male breast cancer & pancreatic cancer; rare muta-
tions in CHEK2 or TP53 a/w c risk in familial breast cancer (JAMA 2006;295:1379)
• Estrogen: c risk with early menarche, late menopause, late parity, or nulliparity (NEJM
2006;354:270); c risk with prolonged HRT (RR  1.24 after 5.6 y, JAMA 2003;289:3243);
no c risk shown with OCP use (NEJM 2002;346:2025)
• Benign breast conditions: c risk w/ atypia (atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia) &
proliferative (ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, radial scar, or sclerosing adenosis) features;
no c risk w/ cysts, fibroadenoma, or columnar changes (NEJM 2005;352:229)
• c risk with h/o ionizing radiation to chest for treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
Clinical manifestations
• Breast mass (hard, irregular, fixed, nontender), nipple discharge (higher risk if unilateral,
limited to one duct, bloody, associated with mass)
• Special types: Paget’s disease S unilateral nipple eczema  nipple discharge;
inflammatory breast cancer S skin erythema and edema (peau d’orange)
• Metastases: lymph nodes, bone, liver, lung, brain
Screening
• Self breast exam (SBE): no proven mortality benefit (JNCI 2002;94:1445); not recommended 
• Clinical breast exam (CBE): benefit independent of mammography not established
• Mammography: 20–30% T in breast cancer mortality (smaller absolute benefit
in women 50 y) (Lancet 2001;358:1340 & 2002;359:909; Annals 2002;137:347; Lancet 2006;368:2053);
75% of all abnl finding benign; suspicious: clustered microcalc., spiculated, enlarging;
adding U/S c Se, but T PPV (JAMA 2008;299:3151)
• ACS/NCI recommend annual mammo  CBE beginning at age 40; USPSTF recommends
begin at 50 and biennially (Annals 2009;151:716), controversial (NEJM 2009;361:2499)
• c risk: screen earlier w/ CBE and mammo (age 25 in BRCA1/2 carrier, 5–10 y before
earliest FHx case, 8–10 y after thoracic XRT, upon dx of c risk benign disease)
• MRI: superior to mammo in high-risk Pts; consider annually if 20% lifetime risk (eg, 
FHx, BRCA 1 or 2, prior chest XRT) (NEJM 2004;351:427; Lancet 2005;365:1769 & 2007;370:485)
• Genetic testing should be considered in women with strong FHx
Diagnostic evaluation
• Palpable breast mass:
Age 30 y S observe for resolution over 1–2 menstrual cycles
Age 30 y, unchanging mass S U/S S aspiration if mass not simple cyst
Age 30 y or solid mass on U/S or bloody aspirate or recurrence after aspiration S
mammo (detect other lesions) and either fine-needle aspir. or core-needle bx
Clearly cancerous on exam or indeter. read/atypia on needle bx S excisional bx
• Suspicious mammogram with normal exam: stereotactically-guided bx
• MRI: detects contralateral cancer in 3% of women w/ recently dx breast cancer &
negative contralateral mammogram (but PPV only 21%) (NEJM 2007;356:1295);
whether to use routinely remains unclear
Staging
• Anatomic: tumor size, chest wall invasion, axillary LN mets (strongest prognostic factor)
• Histopathologic: type (little prognostic relevance) & grade; lymphatic/vascular invasion
In situ carcinoma: no invasion of surrounding stroma
Ductal (DCIS): c risk of invasive cancer in ipsilateral breast (30%/10 y)
Lobular (LCIS): marker of c risk of invasive cancer in either breast (1%/y)
Invasive carcinoma: infiltrating ductal (70–80%); invasive lobular (5–10%); tubular, 
medullary, and mucinous (10%, better prognosis); papillary (1–2%); other (1–2%)
Inflammatory breast cancer (see above): not a histologic type but a clinical reflection
of tumor invasion of dermal lymphatics; very poor prognosis
Paget disease: ductal cancer invading nipple epidermis 	 associated mass
• Biomarkers: determine estrogen, progesterone receptor (ER/PR) and HER2/neu
status for all invasive breast cancers
• Recurrence score and risk with Oncotype DX 21-gene assay in ER , node  Pts

Epidemiology and risk factors (NEJM 2003;349:366)
• Most common cancer in U.S. men; 2nd most common cause of cancer death in men
• Lifetime risk of prostate cancer dx 16%; lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer 3%
• More common with c age (rare if 45 y), in African Americans, and if  FHx
Clinical manifestations (usually asymptomatic at presentation)
• Obstructive sx (more common with BPH): hesitancy, T stream, retention, nocturia
• Irritative sx (also seen with prostatitis): frequency, dysuria, urgency
• Periprostatic spread: hematuria, hematospermia, new-onset erectile dysfunction
• Metastatic disease: bone pain, spinal cord compression, cytopenias
Screening (NEJM 2009;360:1351)
• Mortality benefit from screening has not been established, with one recent trial
showing a 20% T mortality, but another no benefit (NEJM 2009;360:1310 & 1320)
• Digital rectal exam (DRE): size, consistency, lesions
• PSA: 4 ng/mL cutpoint neither Se nor Sp; can c with BPH, prostatitis, acute retention, after
bx or TURP, and ejaculation (no significant c after DRE, cystoscopy);
15% of men 62 y w/ PSA 4 & nl DRE have bx-proven T1 cancer (NEJM 2004;350:2239)
• Per American Cancer Soc., offer PSA  DRE screening to men age 50 (45 if high risk)
with life expectancy 10 y; USPSTF has no rec. for PSA if 75 y, rec. against if 75 y
Diagnostic and staging evaluation
• Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy, with 6–12 core specimens
• Histology: Gleason grade (2–10; low grade 6)  sum of the differentiation score (1 
best, 5  worst) of the two most prevalent patterns in the bx; correlates with prognosis
• Imaging: to evaluate extraprostatic spread
bone scan: for PSA 10 ng/mL, high Gleason grade, or clinically advanced tumor
abdomen-pelvis CT: inaccurate for detecting extracapsular spread and lymph node mets

COLORECTAL CANCER (CRC)
Epidemiology and risk factors
• 4th most common cancer in U.S men and women; 2nd leading cause of cancer death
overall
• Rare before age 40, w/ 90% of cases occurring after age 50. 70% are sporadic.
• Family History: up to 25% of Pts have  FHx. Risk depends on # of 1st degree rela-
tives (w/ CRC or polyp) and their age at dx; 5% have an identifiable germline mutation
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): mutation of APC tumor suppressor S 1000s
of polyps at young age S 100% lifetime risk; c risk of thyroid, stomach, SI cancers
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC): mutations in DNA mis-
match repair genes S c tumor progression S 80% lifetime risk; predom. right-sided
tumors; c risk of endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small bowel cancers.
Amsterdam criteria: 3 family members w/ HNPCC-related cancer, one of
which dx before age 50, affecting 2 successive generations.
• Inflammatory bowel disease: c risk with c extent and duration of disease
• Other factors a/w c risk of CRC: diet rich in animal fat, ? smoking, ? diabetes/obesity
• T risk of adenomas w/ ASA & NSAIDs, incl. COX-2 (NEJM 2006;355:873, 885), but c bleeding
and c CV events w/ COX-2; T COX-2-expressing CRC after prolonged ASA (NEJM
2007;356:2131 & Lancet 2007;369:1603); currently not recommended (Annals 2007;146:361)
Pathology and Genetics (Hematol Oncol Clin North Am 2002;16:127)
• Adenoma S carcinoma sequence reflects accumulation of multiple genetic mutations
c risk of malignancy with large (2.5 cm), villous, sessile adenomatous polyps
Adenomas typically observed 10 y prior to onset of cancer (both sporadic and familial)
• Genetic profile in sporadic CRC: APC (80%), KRAS (50%), TP53 (50–70%), DCC or
SMAD4, chromosomal instability (majority) or mismatch repair deficiency (10–15%)
• Upfront genotyping at dx may guide Rx (eg, KRAS, see below)
Clinical manifestations
• Distal colon:  bowel habits, obstruction, colicky abdominal pain, hematochezia
• Proximal colon: iron defic. anemia, dull vague abd pain; obstruction atypical
due to larger lumen, liquid stool, and polypoid tumors (vs. annular distal tumors)
• Metastases: nodes, liver, lung, peritoneum S RUQ tenderness, ascites, supraclavicular LN
• Associated with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and Clostridium septicum sepsis
Screening (NEJM 2009;361:1179)
• Average risk: colonoscopy starting at age 50 & repeat q10y strongly preferred method
• c risk: earlier and/or more frequent screening.  FHx: age 40 or 10 y before index
dx, then q5y. IBD: 8–10 y after dx, then q1–2y. Known or suspected familial syn-
drome: genetic counseling & very early screening (eg, age 20-25), then q1–2y.
• Colonoscopy: test of choice as examines entire colon; 90% Se for lesions 1 cm. Flex
sig less Se but better than no endoscopy (NEJM 1992;326:653). If polyp found, re ✓in 3–5 y.
• Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): T mortality (NEJM 1993;328:1365 & 2000;343:1603); 3 card
home testing more Se (24% vs. 5%) than DRE/FOBT (Annals 2005;142:81). Repeat q1y.
• Fecal DNA: c Se,  Sp c/w FOBT, but less Se than colonoscopy (NEJM 2004;351:2704)
• CT colonography (CTC): c/w colonoscopy, 90% Se for lesions 1 cm but consid-
erably less for smaller lesions (NEJM 2008;359:1207). Strategy of CTC followed by
colonoscopy for lesions 6 mm diagnoses similar # of advanced neoplasms as
colonoscopy alone, but with only 8% needing colonoscopy (NEJM 2007;357:1403).
However, in high-risk Pts, Se only 85% for advanced neoplasia 6 mm (JAMA
2009;301;2453). ∴? consider CTC if avg risk (w/o personal or FH of polyps/CRC)
(Gastro 2008;134:1578) or if cannot obtain colonoscopy.
Staging (AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th ed, 2010)
• TNM staging: Size/depth of primary (T), locoregional nodes (N), distant metastases (M).
Staging is complex and based on pathologic correlation with observed survival data.
• Colonoscopy  biopsy/polypectomy  intraoperative and pathologic staging
essential for evaluating extracolonic spread
• CT scans of chest and abdomen/pelvis (inaccurate for depth of invasion & malignant LN) 
• Baseline CEA in Pt with known CRC has prognostic significance and is useful to fol-
low response to therapy and detect recurrence; not a screening tool

PANCREATIC TUMORS
Pathology and genetics (Annu Rev Pathol 2008;3:157; Genes Dev 2006;20:1218)
• Histologic types:  adenocarcinoma (85%), acinar cell carcinoma, endocrine tumors, cys-
tic neoplasms (eg, IPMN, see below), rare mets to pancreas (eg, lung, breast, renal cell)
• Pancreatic adenocarcinoma accounts for majority of pancreatic cancer (85%)
• Location: 60% in head, 15% in body, 5% in tail; in 20% diffuse infiltration of pancreas
• Mutations in adenocarc.: KRAS (90%), p16 (80–95%), p53 (50–75%), SMAD4 (55%)
Epidemiology and risk factors (Lancet 2004;363:1049)
• Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is 4th leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men and women
• 80% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas occur in Pts 60–80 y
• Acquired risk factors: smoking (RR 1.5), obesity, chronic pancreatitis, ? diabetes
• Hereditary risk factors: genetic susceptibility may play a role in 5–10% of cases
Hereditary chronic pancreatitis: mutation in cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1)
Familial cancer syndromes and gene mutations with c risk: familial atypical multiple mole
melanoma (CDKN2A/p16), familial breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA2), Peutz-Jeghers
(LKB1), ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM), ? hereditary colorectal cancer (HNPCC and FAP) 
Clinical manifestations
• Painless jaundice (w/ pancreatic head mass), pain (radiating to back), weight loss
• New-onset atypical diabetes mellitus; unexplained malabsorption; unexplained pancreatitis
• Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau’s sign)
• Exam: abdominal mass; nontender, palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier’s sign, but more often
seen with biliary tract cancers); hepatomegaly; ascites; left supraclavicular (Virchow’s)
node & palpable rectal shelf (both nonspecific signs of carcinomatosis)
• Laboratory tests may show c bilirubin, c A, anemia
Diagnostic and staging evaluation
• Pancreatic protocol CT scan (I w/ arterial & venous phase imaging)
• If no lesion seen S EUS, ERCP, MRI/MRCP may reveal mass or malignant ductal strictures
• Biopsy pancreatic lesion via EUS-guided FNA (preferred in potential surgical candidates)
or CT-guided (potential risk of seeding) or biopsy metastasis
• Tumor markers: c CA 19-9 (nb, falsely c in liver failure); may be useful to follow dis. postop

Treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (NEJM 2010;362:1605)
• Resectable: surgery 	 adjuvant (neoadjuvant or postoperative) therapy
pancreaticoduodenectomy  Whipple procedure  resection of pancreatic head,
duodenum, CBD and gallbladder 	 partial gastrectomy
adjuvant therapy: c survival but choice of regimen controversial (chemo vs. chemo/XRT
and gemcitabine vs. 5FU; NEJM 2004;350:2713; JCO 2005;23:4532; JAMA 2007;297:267)
• Locally advanced: optimal strategy controversial. Gemcitabine alone (Ann Oncol
2008;19:1592; Br J Cancer 2007;96:1183; JCO 2009;27:2269); ? gemcitabine  XRT (JCO 2008;26:214s). 
• Metastatic: gemcitabine (JCO 1997;15:2403); adding erlotinib (JCO 2005;23:16S,1) or
capecitabine (JCO 2009;27:5513) may give modest benefit. Offer clinical trials.
• Palliative and supportive care
obstructive jaundice or gastric outlet obstruction: endoscopic stenting or surgical bypass
pain: opiates, celiac plexus neurolysis, radiation therapy
weight loss: pancreatic enzyme replacement, nutrition consult, end-of-life discussions

ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES
FEVER AND NEUTROPENIA (FN)
Definition
• Fever: single oral temp 38.3C (101F) or 38C (100.4F) for 1 h
• Neutropenia: ANC 500 cells/L or 1,000 cells/L with predicted nadir 500 cells/L
Pathophysiology and microbiology
• Predisposing factors: catheters, skin breakdown, GI mucositis, obstruction (lymphat-
ics, biliary tract, GI, urinary tract), immune defect a/w malignancy
• Most episodes thought to result from seeding of bloodstream by GI flora
• Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis): RLQ pain, watery/bloody diarrhea, cecal wall thickening
• GNRs (especially P. aeruginosa) were historically most common
• Gram  infections have recently become more common (60–70% of identified organisms)
• Fungal superinfection often results from prolonged neutropenia & antibiotic use
• Infection with atypical organisms and bacterial meningitis is rare
Prevention
• Levofloxacin (500 mg qd) T febrile episodes & bacterial infections in chemo-related
high-risk neutropenic patients; no difference in mortality (NEJM 2005;353:977, 988)
Diagnostic evaluation
• Exam: skin, oropharynx, lung, perirectal area, surgical & catheter sites; avoid DRE
• Labs: CBC with differential, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, LFTs, U/A
• Micro: blood (peripheral & through each indwelling catheter port), urine, & sputum cx;
for localizing s/s S ✓stool (C. difficile, cx), peritoneal fluid, CSF (rare source)
• Imaging: CXR; for localizing s/s S CNS, sinus, chest, or abdomen/pelvis imaging
• Caveats: neutropenia S impaired inflammatory response S exam and radiographic
findings may be subtle; absence of neutrophils by Gram stain does not r/o infection
Risk stratification (factors that predict lower risk)
• History: age 60 y, no symptoms, no major comorbidities, cancer in remission, solid
tumor, no h/o fungal infection or recent antifungal Rx
• Exam: temp 39 C, no tachypnea, no hypotension, no  MS, no dehydration
• Studies: ANC 100 cells/L, anticipated duration of neutropenia 10 d, normal CXR
Initial antibiotic therapy (Clin Infect Dis 2002;34:730)
• Empiric regimens should include a drug with antipseudomonal activity
• PO abx may be used in low-risk Pts: cipro  amoxicillin-clavulanate (NEJM 1999;341:305)
• IV antibiotics: no clearly superior regimen; monotherapy or 2-drug regimens can be used
Monotherapy: ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem
2-drug therapy: aminoglycoside  antipseudomonal -lactam
PCN-allergic: levofloxacin  aztreonam or aminoglycoside
• Vancomycin added in select cases (hypotension, indwelling catheter, severe mucositis,
MRSA colonization, h/o quinolone prophylaxis), discontinue when cultures   48 h
Modification to initial antibiotic regimen
• Low-risk Pts who become afebrile w/in 3–5 d can be switched to PO antibiotics
• Empiric antibiotics changed for fever 3–5 d or progressive disease (eg, add vancomycin)
• Antifungal therapy is added for neutropenic fever 5 d
liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin, voriconazole,
posaconazole all options (NEJM 2002;346:225 & 2007;356:348)
Duration of therapy
• Known source: complete standard course (eg, 14 d for bacteremia)
• Unknown source: continue antibiotics until afebrile and ANC 500 cells/L
• Less clear when to d/c abx when Pt is afebrile but prolonged neutropenia
Role of hematopoietic growth factors (JCO 2005;23:4198 & 2006;24:3187)
• Granulocyte (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CSF) colony-stimulating fac-
tors can be used as 1 prophylaxis when expected FN incidence 20% or as 2 pro-
phylaxis after FN has occurred in a previous cycle (to maintain dose-intensity for
curable tumors). CSF T rate of FN but have not been shown to impact mortality.
• Colony-stimulating factors can be considered as adjuvant therapy in high-risk FN Pts
SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION
Clinical manifestations
• Metastases located in vertebral body extend and cause epidural spinal cord compression

--- Fim da Página 162 ---

• Prostate, breast, and lung cancer are the most common causes, followed by renal cell
carcinoma, NHL, and myeloma
• Site of involvement: thoracic (70%), lumbar (20%), cervical (10%)
• Signs and symptoms: pain (96%, precedes neuro s), weakness, autonomic
dysfunction (urinary retention, T anal sphincter tone), sensory loss
Diagnostic evaluation
• Always take back pain in Pts with solid tumors very seriously
• Do not wait for neurologic signs to develop before initiating evaluation b/c duration &
severity of neurologic dysfunction before Rx are best predictors of neurologic outcome
• Urgent whole-spine MRI is study of choice. Consider CT myelogram if unable to get MRI.
Treatment
• Dexamethasone (10 mg IV S 4 mg IV or PO q6h)
initiate immediately while awaiting imaging if back pain  neurologic deficits
• Emergent XRT or surgical decompression if confirmed compression / neuro deficits
• Surgery  XRT superior to XRT alone for neuro recovery in solid tumors (Lancet 2005;366:643)
• If pathologic fracture causing compression S surgery; if not surgical candidate S XRT
TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME
Clinical manifestations
• Large tumor burden or a rapidly proliferating tumor S spontaneous or chemotherapy-
induced release of intracellular electrolytes and nucleic acids
• Most common w/ Rx of high-grade lymphomas (Burkitt’s) and leukemias (ALL, AML,
CML in blast crisis); rare with solid tumors; rarely due to spontaneous necrosis
• Electrolyte abnormalities: c K, c uric acid, c PO4 S T Ca
• Renal failure (urate nephropathy)
Prophylaxis
• Allopurinol 300 mg qd to bid PO or 200–400 mg/m2 IV (adjusted for renal fxn) &
aggressive hydration prior to beginning chemotherapy or XRT
• Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) 0.15 mg/kg or 6 mg fixed dose (except in obese
Pts) & aggressive hydration prior to beginning chemotherapy or XRT (see below)
Treatment
• Avoid IV contrast and NSAIDs
• Allopurinol  aggressive IV hydration 	 diuretics to c UOP
• Consider alkalinization of urine w/ isotonic NaHCO3 to c UA solubility & T risk of urate
nephropathy (controversial: may cause metabolic alkalosis or Ca3(PO4)2 precipitation).
• Rasburicase (0.15–0.2 mg/kg/d  3–7 d) for severe c UA, espec in aggressive malig;
UA level must be drawn on ice to quench ex vivo enzyme activity ( JCO 2003;21:4402;
Acta Haematol 2006;115:35)
• Treat hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and symptomatic hypocalcemia
• Hemodialysis may be necessary; early renal consultation for Pts w/ renal insuffic. or ARF

Aspiration
Chemical pneumonitis due to aspiration of gastric contents
(NEJM 2001;334:665)
Bacterial pneumonia 24–72 h later, due to aspiration of 
oropharyngeal microbes
outpatients: typical oral flora (Strep, S. aureus, anaerobes)
inpatients or chronically ill: GNR and S. aureus
Clinical manifestations
• “Typical”: acute onset of fever, cough w/ purulent sputum, dyspnea, consolidation on CXR
• “Atypical” (originally described as culture ): tends to p/w insidious onset of dry
cough, extrapulm sx (N/V, diarrhea, headache, myalgias, sore throat), patchy inter-
stitial pattern on CXR, and c transaminases & T Na w/ Legionella
• S/s & imaging do not reliably distinguish between “typical” (S. pneumo, H. flu) and “atypical”
(Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella, viral) 
Diagnostic studies
• Sputum Gram stain: utility debated. Is it a good sample (ie, sputum or spit) ? S
should be 10 squamous cells/lpf. Is it a purulent sample? S should be 25 PMNs/lpf
• Sputum bacterial culture: should be transported to lab w/in 1–2 h of collection.
In select situations, consider respiratory viral testing (DFA or PCR), rarely viral cx.
• Blood cultures (before antibiotics!):  in 10% of inPts, depending on pathogen
• CXR (PA & lateral; see Radiology inserts) S tap effusions if 5 cm or severe PNA
• Other labs: SaO2 or PaO2, CBC w/ diff, lytes, BUN/Cr, glc, LFTs; arterial pH (if severe)
• Other microbiologic studies (paired serologies available for most atypicals):
Mycoplasma: PCR of throat or sputum/BAL before first dose abx
Legionella: urine Ag (detects L. pneumophila L1 serotype, 60–70% of clinical disease)
S. pneumoniae urinary Ag (Se 50–80%, Sp 90%)
MTb: induced sputum for AFB stain and mycobact. cx (empiric respiratory isolation while
pending); avoid quinolones if considering TB; request rapid DNA probe if stain 
Induced sputum for PCP if HIV  or known T cell-mediated immunity; HIV test if 15–54 y
• Bronchoscopy: consider if Pt immunosupp., critically ill, failing to respond, or has
chronic pneumonia.Also in suspected TB if no adequate sputum and in suspected
PCP if induced sputum unavailable or  but clinical suspicion high.
• Reasons for failure to improve on initial Rx:
Insufficient time: may take 72 h to see clinical improvement
Insufficient drug levels: eg, vanco trough 15–20 g/mL (needed for lung penetration)
Resistant organisms (or superinfxn): eg, MRSA, Pseudomonas; consider bronchoscopy
Wrong dx: fungal/viral, chemical pneumonitis, PE, CHF, ARDS, DAH, ILD; consider CT
Parapneumonic effusion/empyema: esp. seen w/ Strep pneumo, GrpA Strep; if CXR neg,
consider CT (dx tap  chest tube if effusion present, particularly if loculated)
Metastatic infection (endocarditis, meningitis, arthritis), abscess
Prognosis (also see PORT score, next page)
• Pneumonia and influenza are the 8th leading cause of death in the U.S.
• For low-risk Pts, can discharge immediately after switching to PO abx (CID 2007;44:527)
• CXR resolves in most by 6 wks; consider f/u to r/o underlying malignancy or other dx
• Newer metrics proposed to replace Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI, aka PORT score);
simpler parameters, similar performance characteristics, but not as well validated

*When possible, organism-directed therapy, guided by in vitro susceptibilities or local patterns of drug
resistance should be used. For ventilator-associated pneumonia, 8  15 d of Rx, except for Pseudomonas
and other non-fermenting GNR (JAMA 2003;290:2588; AJRCCM 2005;171:388; CID 2007;44:527)
Prevention
• Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine: persons 65 y of age or high-risk medical illness
• VAP precautions: HOB 30
, chlorhexidine rinse; aspiration precautions in high-risk Pts
VIRAL RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS
Microbiology and Epidemiology
• Typical pathogens: short, mild  rhinovirus, coronavirus; longer, more severe or com-
plicated  influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus
• Seasonal flu: 365,000 hosp., 51,000 deaths per y in U.S.; most 65 y (NEJM 2008;359:2579)
• Pandemic 2009 H1N1: more severe disease in younger Pts (JAMA 2009;302:1896)
Diagnosis
•
Primarily clinical: cough, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis
(in contrast, viral bronchitis p/w cough  low-grade temp; usually benign & self-limited)
•
Respiratory viral panel (flu, paraflu, RSV, adeno) on nasal washing or sputum/BAL 
•
Rapid influenza test on nasal swab: Se 50–70% (? lower for pandemic flu), Sp 95%
•
DFA (Se 85%), RT-PCR (gold standard) avail. for influenza (PCR distinguishes type)
Treatment
•
Seasonal influenza: M2 inhib. (amantadine, rimantadine) effective only against some type A;
neuraminidase inhib. (oseltamivir, zanamivir) effective vs.A & B, but resistance emerging
•
Pandemic H1N1 influenza: nearly 100% sensitive to oseltamivir, consider IV peramivir for
critically ill Pts unable to take PO (currently emergency use in U.S.); resistant to amantidine
•
Oseltamivir dosed 75 mg PO bid  5 d, effective only if started w/in 48 h of sx, but used
anytime in immunosupp. & considered in all Pts w/ or predisposed to severe influenza
•
Consider inhaled ribavirin for RSV in immunosupp. (eg, BMT, lung tx); limited adult data
Prevention
• Inactivated influenza vaccine: available for seasonal and select pandemic flu, incl. H1N1
rec if 50 y, at risk for complic., HCW, caretakers of high-risk Pts; for all if surplus
• Isolation, droplet precautions for inPts strongly recommended
• Prophylaxis for high-risk contacts of confirmed influenza: oseltamivir 75 mg PO daily  10 d

• Group II (usually extrem): Strep pyogenes  Staph; often healthy w/o obvious portal
of entry; up to 1⁄2 have toxic shock syndrome (TSS). CA-MRSA can rarely cause
monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis.
Clinical manifestations
• Most common sites: extremities, abdominal wall, and perineum, but can occur anywhere
• Cellulitic skin 	s with poorly defined margins  rapid spread  systemic toxicity
• Pain out of proportion to apparent cellulitis; skin hyperesthetic and later anesthetic

• Vertebral osteomyelitis (seen in Pts over 50 y): unremitting, focal back pain, usually
fever (NEJM 2010;362:1022)
Diagnostic studies (JAMA 2008;299:806)
• Identification of the causative organism is key
• Culture data from tissue (surgical sampling/needle bx), not swabs of ulcers/fistulae
• Blood cultures (more often  with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis)
• ESR 70 greatly increases likelihood of osteo (JAMA 2008;299:806)
• Imaging

MRI: can detect very early changes (overall Se 90%, Sp 82%; Archives 2007;167:125)
CT: can demonstrate periosteal reaction and cortical and medullary destruction
CT & MRI very Se but not completely Sp; false  if contiguous focus w/ periosteal
reaction, Charcot changes
radionuclide imaging: very Se but non-Sp (false  if soft-tissue inflammation)
Treatment

or surgery, lumbar puncture
• Risk factors: diabetes, renal failure, alcoholism, IVDU, immunosuppression
• S. aureus most common pathogen
Clinical manifestations
• Back pain (unremitting including midline)  often fever  nerve root or cord signs
Diagnostic studies
• MRI
• Aspiration of abscess fluid for Gram stain & cx or operative Gram stain & cx 
• Blood cx (frequently )
Treatment
• Antibiotics  surgery (decompressive laminectomy and débridement) for failure
to improve on medical Rx or early s/s of cord compression (w/ vertebral osteo
and epidural abscess, may see paraplegia 48–72 h after first signs)

INFECTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
ACUTE BACTERIAL MENINGITIS
Definition
• Bacterial infection of the subarachnoid space
Microbiology in Adult Meningitis
Etiology
Comments
S. pneumoniae
Look for distant infection (eg, Osler’s triad  meningitis,
(30–60%)
pneumonia, endocarditis).
Drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP):
40% PCN-resistant (even intermed resist problematic for Rx)
10% 3rd-gen. ceph.-resistant
Vaccine reduces rate of invasive disease
N. meningitidis
Primarily in children and young adults; may be associated with 
(10–35%)
petechiae or purpura. Deficiencies in terminal complement 
predispose to recurrent meningococcemia & rarely, meningitis.
Vaccine rec for all adolescents, college freshmen living in dorm,
military recruits, s/p splenectomy, or C5–9 deficiency.
H. influenzae
T Incidence in children because of H. influenzae type b vaccine.
(5%)
Look for predisposing factors in adults (eg, CSF leak, recent
neurosurgical procedure, trauma, mastoiditis).
L. monocytogenes
Seen in elderly, alcoholics, or patients with malignancy,
(5–10%)
immunosuppression, or iron overload. Outbreaks associated with
contaminated milk, cheese, coleslaw, raw vegetables. Despite
name, often associated with poly-predominant pleocytosis.
GNRs
Usually nosocomial or postprocedure or in elderly or 
(1–10%)
immunosuppressed
Staphylococci
Seen with indwelling CSF shunt (S. epidermidis) or following
(5%)
neurosurgery or head trauma (S. aureus)
Mixed infection
Suspect parameningeal focus or CSF leak
Clinical manifestations (NEJM 2006;354:44)
• Fever (77%)
• Headache (87%), stiff neck (83%), and photosensitivity
• 	 MS (69%) (defined as GCS 14), seizures (5%)
• 2 of 4 (fever, HA, stiff neck, 	 MS) present in 95%
• Presentation may be atypical (eg, lethargy w/o fever) in elderly and immunosupp.
Recurrent meningitis
• Bacterial: consider CSF leak, dermal sinus, or other congenital/acquired anatomic defects
• Viral: HSV-2 (causes majority of Mollaret’s meningitis)
• Aseptic (see below): leak from cyst/tumor/lesion with dermoid/epidermoid elements,
autoimmune (eg, SLE, Behçet’s), medications 
Physical exam
• Nuchal rigidity (Se 30%), Kernig’s sign (Pt supine, hip flexed at 90

•  Funduscopic findings: papilledema, absent venous pulsations
•  Rash: maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric
Diagnostic studies
• Blood cultures before abx
• WBC count: 10,000 in 83% of bacterial meningitis 
• Consider head CT to r/o mass effect before LP if presence of high-risk feature (age
60 y, immunosupp., h/o CNS disease, new-onset seizure, 	 MS, focal neuro
findings, papilledema); absence of all these has NPV 97%; however, in Pts w/ mass effect,
herniation may occur w/o LP and may not occur even w/ LP (NEJM 2001;345:1727)
• Lumbar puncture (NEJM 2006;355:e12)
CSF Gram stain has 60–90% Se; cx 70–85% Se if LP done prior to abx
repeat LP only if no clinical response after 48 h of appropriate abx, or CSF shunt present
• Rule of 2s: CSF WBC 2k, glc 20, & TP 200 has 98% Sp for bacterial meningitis

CSF fluid unlikely to be changed if obtained w/in 4 h of initiation of abx.
Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q6h  4 d S T neuro disability & mort. by
50% w/ S. pneumo & GCS 8–11. Consider steroids in all bacterial meningitis prior to
organism identification. Must start before or w/ 1st dose of abx (NEJM 2002;347:1549).
Prophylaxis: rifampin (600 mg PO bid  2 d) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg PO  1) or 
ceftriaxone (250 mg IM  1) for close contacts of Pt w/ meningococcal meningitis
Precautions: droplet precautions until N. meningitidis is ruled out

• HSV-1 (9%): all ages/seasons; MRI: temporal lobe lesions/edema; EEG: temporal focus
• VZV (9%): 1
 or reactivation;  vesicular rash; all ages (favors elderly), all seasons
• Arboviruses (9%): Eastern/Western equine,West Nile, St. Louis, Japanese, Powassan

ADEM), paraneoplastic syndromes, seizure, mitochondrial disorders
Clinical manifestations
• Fever, HA, 	 MS,  seizures and focal neuro findings (latter atypical for viral meningitis)
Diagnostic studies (etiologic dx made in only about 25% of cases)
• Lumbar puncture: lymphocytic pleocytosis; PCR for HSV (95% Se & Sp at 2–3 d),VZV,

Diagnostic studies
• Blood cultures (before abx): at least 3 sets (aerobic & anaerobic bottles) from dif-
ferent sites, ideally spaced 1 h apart. ✓BCx (at least 2 sets) after appropriate abx
have been initiated to document clearance; repeat q24–48h until .
• CBC w/ diff (cWBC common in ABE; anemia in 90% SBE), ESR, RF, BUN/Cr, U/A & UCx
• ECG (on admission and at regular intervals) to assess for new conduction abnormalities
• Echocardiogram: obtain TTE if low clinical suspicion, expect good image quality;
TEE if (i) mod-to-high clinical suspicion, (ii) high-risk Pt (prosthetic valve, prior IE,
CHD), (iii) TTE nondx, (iv) TTE  but endocarditis strongly suspected, or (v) sus-

Treatment
• Obtain culture data first
ABE S abx should be started promptly after culture data obtained

• Adjust abx regimen and duration based on valve (NVE vs. PVE), organism, & sensitivities 
• Repeat BCx qd until Pt defervesces and BCx ; usually 2–3 d
• Fever may persist up to 1 wk after appropriate abx therapy instituted or in setting of
metastatic sites of infection
• Systemic anticoagulation relatively contraindicated given risk of hemorrhagic
transformation of cerebral embolic strokes (however, in absence of cerebral emboli, can
continue anticoagulation for pre-existing indication)
• Monitor for complications of endocarditis (CHF, conduction block, new emboli, etc.)
and complications of abx therapy (interstitial nephritis, renal failure, neutropenia, etc.)
• Duration of Rx: usually 4–6 wks. With NVE & sx 3 mos S 4 wks of abx; sx 3
mos S 6 wks. Uncomplicated right-sided NVE S 2 wks may be comparable. 2–3

Indications for surgery (EHJ 2009;30:2369; Circ 2010;121:1005 & 1141)
• Try for as many days of abx as possible, in hopes of T incidence of recurrent infec-
tion in prosthesis, as well as to improve structural integrity of tissue that will
receive prosthesis
• Severe valvular dysfunction S refractory CHF: emergent if refractory cardio-
genic shock (ie, despite ICU-level Rx); urgent (w/in days) if persistent refractory
HF; elective (w/in wks) if asx severe AI or MR or PVE w/ dehiscence
• Uncontrolled infxn (urgent surgery w/in days indicated): periannular abscess
(10–40% NVE, 60–100% PVE), fistula, worsening conduction, c veg. size, or persis-
tent sepsis (eg,  BCx (? or fever) after 1 wk of appropriate IV abx and no
drainable metastatic focus or other identifiable cause); also consider for S. aureus,
fungal or multiresistant organisms
• Systemic embolism (20–50%): L-sided w/ despite approp. abx, either recurrent emboli,
10 mm veg. & prior embolic event, or 15 mm veg.; risk of embolism 4.8/1000 Pt
days in 1st wk, 1.7/1000 Pt days thereafter; cerebral emboli no longer considered 
contraindic to surgery unless hemorrhage (then ideally wait 1 mo) or severe stroke 
• PVE, especially with valve dysfunction or dehiscence or S. aureus or GNR infection
Prognosis
• NVE: non-IVDU S. aureus S 30–45% mortality; IVDU S. aureus (typically right-sided)
S 10–15% mortality; SBE S 10–15% mortality 
• PVE S 23% mortality

• Confirmatory cultures: draw prior to first abx dose in stable Pts if possible
• Factors favoring endocarditis: bacteremia that is high-grade w/o identifiable source, per-
sisting after line removal or drainage of focal source, in hosts at risk for endocarditis, or

TUBERCULOSIS
Epidemiology
• U.S.: 10–15 million infected (10 c risk if foreign-born or minority); worldwide: 2 billion 
• After resurgence in U.S. 1984–1992, rates have declined, though slower than CDC goals
• Pt is more likely to develop TB disease if:
High-prevalence populations (more likely to be exposed to & infected w/ bacillus):
immigrant from high-prevalence area, homeless or medically underserved, resident or
worker in jail or long-term facility, HCW at facility w/ TB, close contact to Pt w/ active TB
High-risk populations (more likely to progress from infxn S active disease): HIV 
or other immunosupp, chronic renal failure, DM, organ Tx, IVDU, EtOH, mal-
nourished, malignancy, gastrectomy, on biologics (eg,TNF inhibitors, rituximab)
Microbiology and natural history
• Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis via small-particle aerosols (ie, droplet nuclei)
• 90% of infected normal hosts will never develop clinically evident disease, 10% will 
• Localized disease: healing & calcification or progressive 1
 TB (at site of infection)
• Hematogenous spread: latent infection  reactivation TB or progressive disseminated TB
• Two-thirds of clinically evident disease in U.S. due to reactivation
Screening for prior infection
• Whom to screen: high-prevalence and high-risk populations (HIV  Pts should
have PPD testing as part of initial evaluation and annually thereafter)
• How to screen: Mantoux tuberculin test (ie, purified protein derivative or PPD)
inject 5-TU (0.1 mL) intermed. strength PPD intradermally S wheal; examine 48–72 h
• How to interpret PPD: determine max diameter of induration by palpation

Booster effect
c induration due to immunologic boost by prior skin test in previously

but does not represent true conversion due to recent infection. 2nd 
test is Pt’s true baseline. Can be 1 y after initial test.
(NEJM 2002;347:1860)
• IFN- release assays (IGRA): (Ag-stimulated IFN- release from Pt’s T-cells): may
be used for screening where you would use PPD; may have c Sp, esp in BCG Rx’d
Pts (Annals 2008;149:177). Relies on host immune fxn, so Se still limited in immuno-
supp. Lack of gold standard for latent TB infxn compromises Se/Sp estimates (J Clin
Epi 2010;63:257). One-step test, but more expensive than PPD.
Clinical manifestations
• Primary TB pneumonia: middle or lower lobe consolidation,  effusion,  cavitation
• TB pleurisy: can occur w/ primary or reactivation. Due to breakdown of granuloma
w/ spilling of contents into pleural cavity and local inflammation. Pulmonary
effusion  pericardial and peritoneal effusions (tuberculous polyserositis).
• Reactivation TB pulmonary dis.: apical infiltrate  volume loss  cavitation
• Miliary TB: acute or insidious; due to widespread hematogenous dissemination; usu-
ally in immunosupp, DM, EtOH, elderly or malnourished. Constitutional sx
(fever, night sweats, weight loss) usually prominent. Pulm disease w/ small millet
seed–like lesions (2–4 mm) on CXR or chest CT (latter more Se), present in
60–80% of those w/ miliary TB.
• Extrapulmonary TB: lymphadenitis, pericarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, nephritis  sterile
pyuria, osteomyelitis (vertebral  Pott’s disease), hepatitis, splenitis, cutaneous, arthritis
• TB and HIV: HIV-infected & other immunosupp Pts at c risk for infxn, progressive 1
infxn, and reactivation. Risk of progression from infxn to disease 8–10%/y. Can occur at
any CD4 count, but more likely to disseminate at lower CD4 counts. Reinfection (includ-
ing w/ drug-resistant strains) is clinically significant, particularly in hyperendemic areas.
• Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB: resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF)
• Extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB: resistant to INH, RIF, quinolone, & 2nd-line injectables

--- Fim da Página 179 ---

Diagnostic studies for active TB (high index of suspicion is key!)
• Acid-fast smear (rapid dx) and culture (c Se and allows susceptibility testing) of
sputum, bronchoscopic alveolar lavage, pleura, or other clinical specimens; avoid FQ
if considering dx of TB, as they can compromise dx yield
• PCR: 94–97% Se c/w smear; 40–77% Se c/w culture (JAMA 2009;301:1014)
• CXR: classically fibrocavitary apical disease in reactivation vs. middle & lower lobe
consolidation in 1
 TB, but distinction imperfect and HIV  strongly assoc. with non-
apical disease, regardless of timing (JAMA 2005;293:2740)
• Adenosine deaminase (ADA): useful in extrapulmonary sites, best validated for ascites
Preventive therapy (JAMA 2005;293:2776; Annals 2009;150:ITC6-1)
• Appropriate prophylaxis reduces incidence of subsequent disease by 65–75%
• Treat Pts who are  based on screening guidelines listed above, or any exposed HIV  Pt
• R/O active disease in any Pt w/ suggestive s/s before starting INH. If HIV , routinely ask
if cough, fever, or night sweats; if yes S ✓sputum smear, CXR, CD4 (NEJM 2010;362:707).

rates of MDR-TB, exposure to person w/ likely MDR-TB, poor Rx adherence, ? HIV)
• Promote adherence to Rx; directly observed Rx cost effective if high risk for nonadherence
• Obtain monthly smears/cx on treatment until 2 consecutive are  for TB
• Monthly clinical evaluation to monitor for Rx response and adverse drug rxns
• Screen for HIV in all Pts in whom initiating anti-TB Rx; if indicated, should initiate
HIV Rx concurrently (NEJM 2010;362:697)
• Paradoxical worsening of sx can occur after starting Rx. More common w/ extrapulm TB 
(eg, tuberculoma, LAN), likely due to hypersensitivity response to killing of bacilli. More
frequent/severe w/ concurrent immune reconstitution (eg, HIV  Pts started on ARVs,
Pts taken off immunosuppressants, etc). Must r/o treatment failure (repeat Cx, imaging, etc).

HIV/AIDS
Definition
• AIDS: HIV  CD4 count 200/mm3 or opportunistic infection (OI) or malignancy
Epidemiology
• 1 million Americans infected w/ HIV; 6th leading cause of death in 25–44 y-old age group 
• 33.4 million individuals infected worldwide
• Routes: sexual (risk is 0.3% for male-to-male, 0.2% for male-to-female, 0.1% for female-to-
male transmission), IVDA, transfusions, needle sticks (0.3%), vertical (15–40% w/o ARV)
• Postexposure (risk infxn 0.3%) ppx: 2 NRTIs ( PI or NNRTI if high-risk)  4 wks 
Acute retroviral syndrome (ARS)
• Occurs in 40–90% of Pts 2–6 wks after infxn;  ELISA,  viral load (2 wks after infxn)
• Mononucleosis-like syndrome (c incid mucocut. & neuro manifestations c/w EBV or CMV)
Diagnostic studies
• ELISA for HIV-1 Ab:  1–12 wks after acute infection; 99% Se; 1
 screen test
• Western blot:  if 2 bands from diff regions of HIV genome; 99% Sp; confirmatory
after  ELISA
• Rapid preliminary tests: 4 Ab tests; use saliva, plasma, blood, or serum; 99% Se &
96–99% Sp (Annals 2008;149:153); PPV in low prev populations as low as 50% 
• PCR (viral load): detects HIV-1 RNA in plasma; assay range is 48–10 million copies/mL
2% false , but usually low # copies; in contrast, should be very high (750 k) in 1
 infxn
• When testing, obtain informed consent for ELISA,Western, and PCR
• HIV screening is recommended for all Pts in all health care settings (MMWR Sept 22, 2006)
• CD4 count: not a dx test per se, as may be HIV  and have a normal CD4 count or
may have a low CD4 count and not be HIV ; many other illnesses impact CD4 count
Initial approach to HIV  Pt
• Document HIV infection (if adequate documentation is not available, repeat dx studies)
• H&P (mucocutaneous, neurocognitive issues, OIs, malignancies, STDs); review all
ARVs and other meds
• Lab evaluation: CD4 count, viral load, HIV genotype, CBC w/ diff., Cr, lytes, LFTs, fasting
glc and lipids; PPD or IGRA, syphilis serology; toxoplasmosis & CMV IgG; HAV, HBV, &
HCV serologies; Chlamydia & gonorrhea screening; baseline CXR; Pap smear in 

LYME DISEASE
Microbiology
• Infection with spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (consider coinfection w/ Ehrlichia, Babesia)
• Transmitted by ticks (Ixodes, deer tick); animal hosts include deer and mice
• Infection usually requires tick attachment 36–48 h
Epidemiology
• Most common vector-borne illness in U.S.; peak incidence in summer (May–Aug)
• Majority of cases in NY, NJ, CT, RI,WI, PA, MA, ME, NH, MI, MD, DE, northern CA
• Humans contact ticks usually in fields with low brush near wooded areas
Clinical Manifestations
Stage
Manifestations
Stage 1
Due to local effects of spirochete. General: flu-like illness
(early localized)
Derm (80%): erythema migrans (EM)  erythematous patches w/
wks after infection
central clearing, size 6–38 cm; lymphocytomas; regional LAN
Stage 2
Due to spirochetemia and immune response
(early dissem.)
General: fatigue, malaise, LAN, HA; fever uncommon
wks to mos after
Derm: multiple (1–100) annular lesions  EM
infection
Rheum (10%): migratory arthralgias (knee & hip) & myalgias
Neurologic (15%): cranial neuropathies (esp. CN VII), aseptic 
meningitis, mononeuritis multiplex ( pain), transverse myelitis
Cardiac (8%): heart block, myopericarditis
Stage 3
Due to chronic infection or autoimmune response
(late persistent)
Derm: acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, panniculitis
mos to y after
Rheum (60%): joint pain, recurrent mono- or oligoarthritis of
infection
large joints (classically knee), synovitis
Neurologic: subacute encephalomyelitis, polyneuropathy, dementia
(Lancet 2003;362:1639; CID 2006;43:1089; NEJM 2007;357:1422)
Diagnostic studies
• In general, a clinical diagnosis, but rigorous dx requires confirmatory testing (per IDSA)
• Serology (in right clinical setting): screen w/ ELISA, but false  due to other spirochetal
diseases, SLE, RA, EBV, HIV, etc.; false  due to early abx therapy or w/in 6 wks of infxn
confirm  ELISA results w/ Western blot (c Sp)
• ✓CSF if suspected neuro disease:  intrathecal Ab if (IgGCSF/IgGserum)/(albCSF/albserum) 1
Treatment (NEJM 2006;354:2794)
• Prophylaxis (best prevention is tick avoidance): protective clothing, tick ✓q24h, DEET
Chemoprophylaxis w/ doxycycline 200 mg PO  1 only if all of the following:
1. Ixodes scapularis tick attached 36 h
2. Local Lyme carriage in ticks 20% (peak season in New England, mid-Atl, MN,WI)
3. Abx can be given w/in 72 h 
4. No contraindic to doxy (eg, preg, allergy, age 8 y)
If all the above met, NNT still 40–150 to prevent 1 case of Lyme (NEJM 2001;345:79)
Regardless of ppx, monitor for fever, flu-like sx, rash (erythema migrans)  30 d
• Antibiotics: if clin. manifestations and  serology (? and h/o tick bite if nonendemic area)
local or early dissem. w/o neuro or cardiac involvement: doxycycline 100 mg PO
bid  2 wks (range: 10–21 d); alternative (eg, pregnancy, doxy allergy): amox 
500 mg PO tid or cefuroxime 500 mg PO bid  14–21 d
neuro (other than isolated CN VII palsy), cardiac, chronic arthritis: ceftriaxone
2 g IV daily  2–4 wks; alternative (eg, severe -lactam allergy): doxy 100–200 mg
PO bid x 2–4 wks
• Consider coinfection if severe/refractory sx, persistent fever, cytopenias

PITUITARY DISORDERS
HYPOPITUITARY SYNDROMES
Panhypopituitarism
• Etiologies
Primary: surgery, radiation, tumors (primary or metastatic), infection, infiltration
(sarcoid, hemochromatosis), autoimmune, ischemia (including Sheehan’s syndrome
caused by pituitary infarction intrapartum), carotid aneurysms, cavernous sinus
thrombosis, trauma
Secondary (hypothalamic dysfunction or stalk interruption): tumors (including
craniopharyngioma), infection, infiltration, radiation, surgery, trauma
• Clinical manifestations
Hormonal: acute S weakness, easy fatigability, hypotension, polyuria and polydipsia;
chronic S bradycardia, sexual dysfxn, loss of axillary & pubic hair, wt loss, amenorrhea
Mass effect: headache, visual field s, cranial nerve palsies, galactorrhea
Apoplexy (pituitary hemorrhage or infarction, usually w/ underlying pituitary adenoma):
sudden headache, N/V, visual field s, cranial nerve palsies, meningismus,  MS,
hypoglycemia, hypotension
• Diagnostic studies
Hormonal studies
chronic: T target gland hormone  T or normal trophic pituitary hormone
acute: target gland hormonal studies may be normal
partial hypopituitarism is more common than panhypopituitarism
Pituitary MRI
• Treatment
Replace deficient target gland hormones
Most important deficiencies to recognize and treat in inpatients are adrenal insufficiency
and hypothyroidism; if both present, treat with glucocorticoids first, then replace
thyroid hormone so as not to precipitate adrenal crisis
T ACTH
• Adrenal insufficiency similar to 1 (see “Adrenal Disorders”) except:
no salt cravings or hypokalemia (b/c aldo preserved)
no hyperpigmentation (b/c ACTH/MSH is not c)
T TSH
• Central hypothyroidism similar to 1 (see “Thyroid Disorders”) except absence of goiter
• Dx with free T4 in addition to TSH, as TSH may be low or inappropriately normal
T PRL
• Inability to lactate
T GH
• c chronic risk for osteoporosis, fatigue, weight gain
• Dx with failure to c GH w/ appropriate stimulus (eg, insulin tolerance test, glucagon
stimulation)
• GH replacement in adults controversial
T FSH & LH
• Clinical manifestations: T libido, impotence, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility
• Physical examination: T testicular size; loss of axillary, pubic, and body hair
• Dx with: T a.m. testosterone or estradiol and  T or normal FSH/LH (all levels
T in acute illness, ∴do not measure in hospitalized Pts)
• Treatment: testosterone or estrogen replacement vs. correction of the underlying cause
T ADH (hypothalamic or stalk disease): diabetes insipidus
• Clinical manifestations: severe polyuria, mild hypernatremia (severe if T access to H2O)
• Diagnostic studies: see “Disorders of Sodium Homeostasis”

HYPERPITUITARY SYNDROMES
Pituitary tumors
• Pathophysiology: adenoma S excess of trophic hormone (if tumor fxnal, but 30–40%
not) and potentially deficiencies in other trophic hormones due to compression;
cosecretion of PRL and growth hormone in 10% of prolactinomas
• Clinical manifestations: syndromes due to oversecretion of hormones (see below)
 mass effect: headache, visual s, diplopia, cranial neuropathies
• Workup: MRI, hormone levels,  visual field testing, consider MEN1 (see below)
if 10 mm, ∅mass effect, no hormonal effects, can f/up q 3–6 mos
Hyperprolactinemia (NEJM 2010;362:1219)
• Etiology
prolactinoma (50% of pituitary adenomas)
stalk compression due to nonprolactinoma S T inhibitory dopamine S c PRL (mild)
• Physiology: PRL induces lactation and inhibits GnRH S T FSH & LH
• Clinical manifestations: amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, T libido, impotence
• Diagnostic studies: c PRL, but elevated in many situations, ∴r/o pregnancy or
exogenous estrogens, hypothyroidism, dopamine agonists (psych meds, antiemetics),
renal failure (T clearance), cirrhosis, stress, c carb diet. MRI to evaluate for tumor,
visual field testing if MRI shows compression of optic chiasm.
• Treatment
If asx (no HA or hypogonadal sx) and microadenoma (10 mm), follow with MRI
If sx or macroadenoma (10 mm) options include:
medical with dopamine agonist such as bromocriptine (70–100% success rate) or
cabergoline (better tolerated); side effects include N/V, orthostasis, nasal congestion
surgical: transsphenoidal surgery (main indications: failed medical Rx, GH co-secretion,
or neurologic sx not improving); 10–20% recurrence rate
radiation: if medical or surgical therapy have failed or are not tolerated
Acromegaly (c GH; 10% of adenomas; NEJM 2006;355:2558)
• Physiology: stimulates secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
• Clinical manifestations: c soft tissue, arthralgias, jaw enlargement, headache, carpal tunnel
syndrome, macroglossia, hoarseness, sleep apnea, amenorrhea, impotence, diabetes
mellitus, acanthosis/skin tags, c sweating, HTN/CMP, colonic polyps
• Diagnostic studies: no utility in checking random GH levels because of pulsatile secretion
c IGF-1 (somatomedin C);  c PRL; pituitary MRI to evaluate for tumor
oral glc tolerance test S GH not suppressed to 1 (0.3 if newer assay) ng/mL by 2 h
• Treatment: surgery, octreotide (long- and short-acting preparations), dopamine 
agonists (if PRL co-secretion), pegvisomant (GH receptor antagonist), radiation
• Prognosis: w/o Rx there is 2–3 c mortality, risk of pituitary insufficiency, colon cancer
Cushing’s disease (c ACTH): 10–15% of adenomas; see “Adrenal Disorders”
Central hyperthyroidism (c TSH, c -subunit): extremely rare; see “Thyroid Disorders”
c FSH & LH: usually non-fxn, presents as hypopituitarism b/c of compression effects

HYPOTHYROIDISM
Etiologies
• Primary (
90% of cases of hypothyroidism; T free T4, c TSH)
Goitrous: Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, recovery after thyroiditis, iodine defic., Li, amiodarone
Nongoitrous: surgical destruction, s/p radioactive iodine or XRT, amiodarone
• Central (T free T4,low/nl or slightly high TSH):hypothalamic or pituitary failure (TSH levels T or
“normal,” can be slightly c although functionally inactive due to abnormal glycosylation)
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
• Autoimmune destruction with patchy lymphocytic infiltration
• Associated with other autoimmune disease and may be part of PGA syndrome type II
•  antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) Abs in 
90%
Clinical manifestations (Lancet 2004;363:793)
• Early: weakness, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, depression, cold intolerance,
weight gain, constipation, menorrhagia, dry skin, coarse brittle hair, brittle nails, carpal
tunnel syndrome, delayed DTRs (“hung up” reflexes), diastolic HTN, hyperlipidemia
• Late: slow speech, hoarseness, loss of outer third of eyebrows, myxedema
(nonpitting skin thickening due to c glycosaminoglycans), periorbital puffiness,
bradycardia, pleural, pericardial, & peritoneal effusions, atherosclerosis
• Myxedema coma: hypothermia, hypotension, hypoventilation,  MS
Diagnostic studies
• T FT4; c TSH in primary hypothyroidism;  antithyroid Ab in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
• May see hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, anemia, c LDL, T HDL, and c CK
• Screening recommended for pregnant women
Treatment of overt hypothyroidism
• Levothyroxine (1.5–1.7 g/kg/d), re ✓TSH q5–6wks and titrate until euthyroid;
sx can take mos to resolve; lower starting dose (0.3–0.5 g/kg/d) if at risk for
ischemic heart disease; advise Pt to keep same formulation of levothyroxine;
c dose typically needed if: pregnancy (30% c by wk 8), initiation of estrogen 
replacement, poor GI absorption (concomitant Fe or Ca suppl., PPI, sucralfate,
celiac disease, IBD)
• Myxedema coma: load 5–8 g/kg T4 IV, then 50–100 g IV qd; b/c peripheral 
conversion impaired, may also give 5–10 g T3 IV q8h if unstable w/ bradycardia 
and/or hypothermia (T3 more arrhythmogenic); must give empiric adrenal replace-
ment therapy first as T adrenal reserves in myxedema coma
Subclinical hypothyroidism (NEJM 2001;345:260)
• Mild c TSH and normal free T4 with only subtle or no sx
• If c titers of antithyroid Abs, progression to overt hypothyroidism is 4%/y
• Rx controversial: follow expectantly or treat to improve mild sx or dyslipidemia
most initiate Rx if TSH 
10 mU/L, goiter, pregnancy, or infertility
HYPERTHYROIDISM
Etiologies (Lancet 2003;362:459)
• Graves’ disease (60–80% of thyrotoxicosis)
• Thyroiditis: thyrotoxic phase of subacute (granulomatous) thyroiditis or painless
(lymphocytic) thryoiditis
• Toxic adenomas (single or multinodular goiter) 
• TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (cTSH, c free T4)
• Misc: amiodarone, iodine-induced, thyrotoxicosis factitia, struma ovarii (3% of ovarian
dermoid tumors and teratomas), hCG-secreting tumors (eg, choriocarcinoma),
large deposits of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer
Graves’ disease (NEJM 2008;358:2594)
• Female:male ratio is 5–10:1, most Pts between 40 and 60 y at dx
•  thyroid antibodies: TSI or TBII ( in 80%), anti-TPO, antithyroglobulin; ANA
• Clinical manifestations in addition to those of hyperthyroidism (see below):
goiter: diffuse, nontender, w/ thyroid bruit
ophthalmopathy (NEJM 2009;360:994): Seen in 50%; up to 90% if formally tested.
Periorbital edema, lid retraction, proptosis, conjunctivitis, diplopia (EOM infiltration);
associated w/ smoking. Stare and lid lag seen in any type of hyperthyroidism.
pretibial myxedema (3%): infiltrative dermopathy
THYROID
7-4

--- Fim da Página 192 ---

Clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism
• Restlessness, sweating, tremor, moist warm skin, fine hair, tachycardia, AF, weight loss,
c frequency of stools, menstrual irregularities, hyperreflexia, osteoporosis, stare and
lid lag (due sympathetic overactivity)
• Apathetic thyrotoxicosis: seen in elderly who can present with lethargy as only sx
• Thyroid storm (extremely rare): delirium, fever, tachycardia, systolic hypertension but
wide pulse pressure and T MAP, GI symptoms; 20–50% mortality
Laboratory testing
• c FT4 and FT3; T TSH (except in TSH-secreting tumors)
• RAIU scan is very useful study to differentiate causes (see table on page 7-3)
• Rarely need to ✓for autoantibodies except in pregnancy (to assess risk of fetal Graves’)
• May see hypercalciuria  hypercalcemia, c A, anemia
Treatment
• -blockers: control tachycardia (propranolol also T T4 S T3 conversion)
• Graves’ disease: either antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine (NEJM 2005;352:905)
methimazole: 70% chance of recurrence after 1 y; side effects include pruritus,
rash, arthralgia, fever, N/V, and agranulocytosis in 0.5%. PTU: 2nd line (risk of
hepatocellular necrosis; TID dosing; slower effect). For both, need to ✓LFTs,
WBC, TSH at baseline and in follow-up.
radioactive iodine (RAI): preRx selected Pts w/ cardiovascular disease or elderly
w/ antithyroid drugs to prevent c thyrotoxicosis, stop 3 d before to allow RAI
uptake; 
75% of treated Pts become hypothyroid
surgery: less commonly chosen for Graves’, usually for Pts w/ obstructive goiter
or ophthalmopathy
• Toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter: RAI or surgery (methimazole preRx for
surgery, in selected patients before RAI)
• Thyroid storm: -blocker, PTU, iopanoic acid or iodide (for Wolff-Chaikoff effect) 
1 h
after PTU,  steroids (T T4 S T3)
• Ophthalmopathy: can worsen after RAI, prevented by prophylactic Rx w/ prednisone in
high-risk patients; can be Rx’d w/ radiation and/or surgical decompression of the orbits
Subclinical hyperthyroidism (NEJM 2001;345:512)
• Mild T TSH and normal free T4 with only subtle or no sx
• 15% will develop overt hyperthyroidism in 2 y; c risk of AF & osteoporosis
• Rx controversial: consider if TSH 0.1 mU/L and c risk for CV disease or osteopenic
THYROIDITIS (NEJM 2003;348:2646)
• Acute: bacterial infection (very rare in U.S. except postsurgical)
• Subacute: transient thyrotoxicosis S transient hypothyroidism S normal thyroid fxn
painful (viral, granulomatous, or de Quervain’s): fever, c ESR; Rx 	 NSAIDs,ASA, steroids
silent (postpartum, autoimmune, or lymphocytic): painless,  TPO Abs; if 
postpartum, can recur with subsequent pregnancies
other: amiodarone, palpation thyroiditis, after radiation
• Chronic: Hashimoto’s (hypothyroidism), Riedel’s (idiopathic fibrosis)
NONTHYROIDAL ILLNESS (SICK EUTHYROID SYNDROME)
• TFT abnormalities in Pts w/ severe nonthyroidal illness (∴in acute illness, ✓TFTs only
if c concern for thyroid disease); may have acquired transient central hypothyroidism
• If thyroid dysfxn suspected in critically ill Pt, TSH alone not reliable; must measure total
T4, FT4, & T3
• Mild illness: T T4 S T3 conversion, c rT3 ⇒T T3; in severe illness: T TBG & albumin, cc rT3
⇒TT T3, c degradation of T4, central T TSH ⇒TT T3, TT T4, T FT4, T TSH
• Recovery phase: c TSH followed by recovery of T4 and then T3
• Replacement thyroxine not helpful or recommended for critically ill Pts w/ T T3 and T4
unless other s/s of hypothyroidism
AMIODARONE AND THYROID DISEASE
Risk of thyroid dysfunction is lower with lower doses
✓TSH prior to therapy, at 4-mo intervals on amio, and for 1 y after if amio d/c’d
Hypothyroidism (occurs in 10%; more common in iodine-replete areas)
• Pathophysiology
(1) Wolff-Chaikoff effect: iodine load T I uptake, organification, and release of T4 & T3
(2) inhibits T4 S T3 conversion
(3) ? direct/immune-mediated thyroid destruction

• Normal individuals: T T4; then escape Wolff-Chaikoff effect and have c T4, T T3, c TSH;
then TSH normalizes (after 1–3 mos)
• Susceptible individuals (eg, subclinical Hashimoto’s, ∴✓anti-TPO) do not escape effects
• Treatment: thyroxine to normalize TSH; may need larger than usual dose
Hyperthyroidism (3% of Pts on amio; 10–20% of Pts in iodine-deficient areas)
• Type 1 	 underlying multinodular goiter or autonomous thyroid tissue
pathophysiology: Jod-Basedow effect (iodine load S c synthesis of T4 and T3 in
autonomous tissue)
diagnostic studies: c thyroid blood flow on Doppler U/S; treatment: methimazole
• Type 2 	 destructive thyroiditis
pathophysiology: c release of preformed T4 & T3 S hyperthyroidism
S hypothyroidism S recovery
diagnostic studies: T flow on Doppler U/S; treatment: steroids
• Type 1 vs. 2 often difficult to distinguish and Rx for both initiated (JCEM 2001;86:3)
THYROID NODULES
• Prevalence 5–10% (50–60% if screen with U/S), 5% malignant
• Features associated w/ c risk of malignancy: age 20 or 
70 y, male sex, h/o neck XRT,

Treatment of Cushing’s syndrome
• Surgical resection of pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor, or ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor
• If transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) not successful S pituitary XRT, medical adrenalectomy
w/ mitotane, or bilat surgical adrenalectomy; ketoconazole ( metyrapone) to T cortisol
• Glucocorticoid replacement therapy  6–36 mos after TSS (lifelong glucocorticoid 
mineralocorticoid replacement if medical or surgical adrenalectomy)
HYPERALDOSTERONISM
Etiologies
• Primary (adrenal disorders, renin independent increase in aldosterone)
adrenal hyperplasia (70%), adenoma (Conn’s syndrome, 25%), carcinoma (5%)
glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA; ACTH-dep. rearranged promoter)
• Secondary (extra-adrenal disorders, c aldosterone is renin dependent)
Primary reninism: renin-secreting tumor (rare)
Secondary reninism
renovascular disease: RAS, malignant hypertension
edematous states w/ T effective arterial volume: CHF, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome
hypovolemia, diuretics,T2D, Bartter’s (defective Na/K/2Cl transporter  receiving loop
diuretic), Gitelman’s (defective renal Na/Cl transporter  receiving thiazide diuretic)
• Nonaldosterone mineralocorticoid excess mimics hyperaldosteronism
11-HSD deficiency (S lack of inactivation of cortisol, which binds to otherwise
nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor)
Black licorice (glycyrrhizinic acid inhibits 11-HSD), extreme hypercortisolism
(overwhelming 11-HSD), exogenous mineralocorticoids
Liddle’s syndrome (constitutively activated/overexpressed distal tubular renal Na channel)
Clinical manifestations
• Mild to moderate HTN (11% of Pts w/ HTN refractory to 3 drugs; Lancet
2008;371:1921), headache, muscle weakness, polyuria, polydipsia; no peripheral edema
because of “escape” from Na retention; malignant HTN is rare
• Classically hypokalemia (but often normal), metabolic alkalosis, mild hypernatremia
Diagnostic studies
• 5–10% of Pts w/ HTN; ∴screen if HTN  hypokalemia, adrenal mass, or refractory HTN
• Screening: aldosterone (
15–20 ng/dL) and plasma aldosterone:renin ratio (
20 if 1)
obtain 8 a.m. paired values (off spironolactone & eplerenone for 6 wks); Se & Sp 
85%
• ACEI/ARB, diuretics, CCB can c renin activity S T PAC/PRA ratio and Bs may c
PAC/PRA ratio; ∴avoid. -blockers generally best to control HTN during dx testing.
• Confirm with sodium suppression test (fail to suppress aldo after sodium load)
oral salt load ( KCl)  3 d, ✓24-h urine ( if aldo 
12 g/d while Na 
200 mEq/d)
or 2L NS over 4 h, measure aldo at end of infusion ( if aldo

Treatment
• Adenoma or carcinoma S surgery
• Hyperplasia S spironolactone or eplerenone; GRA S glucocorticoids  spironolactone
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY
Etiologies
• Primary 	 adrenocortical disease 	 Addison’s disease
autoimmune: isolated or in assoc w/ PGA syndromes (see table on page 7-2)
infection: TB, CMV, histoplasmosis
vascular: hemorrhage (usually in setting of sepsis), thrombosis, and trauma
metastatic disease: (90% of adrenals must be destroyed to cause insufficiency)
deposition diseases: hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis
drugs: ketoconazole, etomidate (even after single dose), rifampin, anticonvulsants
• Secondary 	 pituitary failure of ACTH secretion (but aldosterone intact b/c RAA axis)
any cause of primary or secondary hypopituitarism (see “Pituitary Disorders”)
glucocorticoid therapy (can occur after 2 wks of “suppressive doses”; dose effect
variable; 10 mg prednisone daily chronically can be suppressive) 
megestrol (a progestin with some glucocorticoid activity)
Clinical manifestations (NEJM 1996;335:1206)
• Primary or secondary: weakness and fatigability (99%), anorexia (99%),
orthostatic hypotension (90%), nausea (86%), vomiting (75%), hyponatremia (88%)
• Primary only (extra s/s due to lack of aldosterone and c ACTH): marked orthostatic
hypotension (because volume-depleted), hyperpigmentation (seen in creases, mucous
membranes, pressure areas, nipples), hyperkalemia
• Secondary only:  other manifestations of hypopituitarism (see “Pituitary Disorders”)
Diagnostic studies
• Early a.m. serum cortisol: 3 g/dL virtually diagnostic; 18 g/dL rules it out
(except in severe septic shock—see below)
• Standard (250 g) cosyntropin stimulation test (testing ability of ACTH S c cortisol)
normal 	 60-min post-ACTH cortisol 18 g/dL
abnormal in primary b/c adrenal gland diseased and unable to give adequate output
abnormal in chronic secondary b/c adrenals atrophied and unable to respond
(very rarely, may be normal in acute secondary b/c adrenals still able to respond;
early a.m. cortisol can be used rather than post-stim value in these cases)
• Low-dose (1 g) cort stim: ? more Se than high-dose test (controversial)
• Other tests to evaluate HPA axis (w/ guidance by endocrinologist): insulin-induced
hypoglycemia (measure serum cortisol response); metyrapone (blocks cortisol synthesis
and therefore stimulates ACTH, measure plasma 11-deoxycortisol and urinary 
17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels)
• Other lab abnormalities: hypoglycemia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis,  neutropenia
• ACTH: c in 1, T or low-normal in 2
• Imaging studies to consider
pituitary MRI to detect anatomical abnormalities
adrenal CT: small, noncalcified adrenals in autoimmune, enlarged in metastatic disease,
hemorrhage, infection, or deposition (although they may be normal-appearing)
Adrenal insufficiency & critical illness (NEJM 2003;348:727; JAMA 2009;301:2362)
• Perform ACTH stim ASAP in hypotensive Pt suspected to have absolute adrenal insuffic. 
• Initiate corticosteroids early: use dexamethasone 2–4 mg IV q6h  fludrocortisone 50 g
daily prior to ACTH stim; change to hydrocortisone 50–100 mg IV q6–8h once
test completed.
• Rx of relative adrenal insufficiency controversial (see “Sepsis”).
Treatment
• Acute insufficiency: volume resuscitation w/ normal saline  hydrocortisone IV as above 
• Chronic insufficiency
Hydrocortisone: 20–30 mg PO qd (2⁄3 a.m. 1⁄3 early p.m.) or prednisone 5 mg PO qam
Fludrocortisone (not needed in 2 adrenal insufficiency): 0.05–0.1 mg PO qam
back-up dexamethasone 4 mg IM prefilled syringe given to Pt for emergency situations

PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
Clinical manifestations (five Ps)
• Pressure (hypertension, paroxysmal in 50%, severe and resistant to therapy)
• Pain (headache, chest pain)
• Palpitations (tachycardia, tremor, wt loss, fever)
• Perspiration (profuse)
• Pallor (vasoconstrictive spell)
• “Rule of 10”: 10% extra-adrenal (known as paraganglioma), 10% in children,
10% multiple or bilateral, 10% recur (c in paraganglioma), 10% malignant (c in
paraganglioma), 10% familial, 10% incidentaloma
• Emotional stress does not trigger paroxysms, but abdominal manipulation can trigger
catecholamine release; some reports of IV contrast causing paroxysms
• Associated with MEN 2A/2B, Von Hippel Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, familial
paraganglioma (mutations in succinate dehydrogenase gene, B, C and D)
Diagnostic studies
• 24 urinary fractionated metanephrines & catechols: 90% Se, 98% Sp ( JCEM 2003;88:553).
Screening test of choice if low-risk (as false  with severe illness, renal failure, OSA,
labetalol due to assay interference, TCAs, medications containing sympathomimetics)
• Plasma free metanephrines: 99% Se, 89% Sp (JAMA 2002;287:1427). Screening test of choice
if high-risk, but c rate of false  in low-preval. population.
• Adrenal CT or MRI; consider MIBG scintigraphy if CT/MRI , PET can be used to
localize nonadrenal mass, but usually easy to find
• Consider genetic testing in appropriate circumstances (bilateral, young Pt,  FHx,
extra-adrenal)
Treatment
• -blockade first (usually phenoxybenzamine)  -blockade (often propranolol) S surgery
ADRENAL INCIDENTALOMAS
Epidemiology
• 4% of Pts undergoing abdominal CT scan have incidentally discovered adrenal mass;
prevalence c with age
Differential diagnosis
• Nonfunctioning mass: adenoma, cysts, abscesses, granuloma, hemorrhage, lipoma,
myelolipoma, primary or metastatic malignancy
• Functioning mass: pheochromocytoma, adenoma (cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones),
nonclassical CAH, other endocrine tumor, carcinoma
• Nonadrenal mass: renal, pancreatic, gastric, artifact
Workup (NEJM 2007;356:601)
• Rule out subclinical Cushing’s syndrome in all Pts using 1 mg overnight DST 
(Sp 91%). Abnormal results require confirmatory testing.
• Rule out hyperaldosteronism if hypertensive w/ plasma aldo & renin (see above).
• Rule out pheochromocytoma in all Pts (b/c of morbidity unRx’d pheo) using 24-h
urine fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines or plasma free metanephrines.
• Rule out metastatic cancer and infection by history or CT-guided biopsy if suspicious
(in Pts w/ h/o cancer, 50% of adrenal incidentalomas are malignant)
• CT and MRI characteristics may suggest adenoma vs. carcinoma
Benign features: size 4 cm; smooth margins, homogenous and hypodense appearance;
unenhanced CT 10 Hounsfield units or CT contrast-medium washout 
50% at
10 min. Can follow such incidentalomas w/ periodic scans.
Suspicious features: size 
4 cm or c size on repeat scan; irregular margins,
heterogeneous, dense, or vascular appearance; h/o malignancy or young age
(incidentaloma less common). Such incidentalomas warrant FNA biopsy, repeat
scan in 3 mos, or resection.

treatment: strict BP control using ACE inhibitors (NEJM 1993;329:1456 & 35:1941; Lancet
1997;349:1787) or ARBs (NEJM 2001;345:851, 861), low-protein diet, dialysis, or transplant
• Neuropathy
symmetric peripheral: symmetric distal sensory loss, paresthesias, 	 motor loss
autonomic: gastroparesis, constipation, neurogenic bladder, erectile dysfxn, orthostasis
mononeuropathy: sudden-onset peripheral or CN deficit (footdrop, CN III VI  IV)
• Accelerated atherosclerosis: coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial beds
• Infections: UTI, osteomyelitis of foot, candidiasis, mucormycosis, necrotizing external otitis
• Dermatologic: necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, lipodystrophy, acanthosis nigricans
Outpatient screening and treatment goals (Diabetes Care 2009;32:193 & S1:S13)
• ✓HbA1C q3–6mo, goal 7% for most Pts (NEJM 2008;358:2545, 2560); microvascular &
macrovascular complications T by strict glycemic control in T1D (NEJM 1993;329:997 &
2005;353:2643) & T2D (Lancet 1998;352:837; NEJM 2008;359:1577; Lancet 2009;373:1765; Annals 2009;151:394)
• Microalbuminuria screening yearly with spot microalbumin/Cr ratio, goal 30 mg/g
• BP 130/80; LDL 100,TG 150, HDL 40; benefit of statins even w/o overt CAD
(Lancet 2003;361:2005 & 2004;364:685);ASA if age 50 () or 60 () or other cardiac risk
factors (Circ 2010;121:2694)
• Dilated retinal exam yearly; comprehensive foot exam qy (Diabetes Care 2009;32:51, 513)
Management of hyperglycemia in inpatients 
• Identify reversible causes/exacerbaters (dextrose IVF, glucocorticoids, postop, c carb diet)
• Dx studies: BG fingersticks (fasting, qAC, qHS; or Q6h if NPO), HbA1C
• Treatment goals: avoid hypoglycemia, extreme hyperglycemia (180 mg/dL)
• Modification of outPt treatment regimen: In T1D, do not stop basal insulin (can cause DKA).
In T2D: stopping oral DM meds generally preferred to avoid hypoglycemia or med
interaction (except if short stay, excellent outPt cntl, no plan for IV contrast, nl diet) 
• InPt insulin: can use outPt regimen as guide; if insulin naïve:
total daily insulin  wt (kg) 
 2, to start; adjust as needed
give 1⁄2 of total daily insulin as basal insulin in long-acting form to target fasting glc  
give other 1⁄2 as short-acting boluses (standing premeal & sliding scale corrective insulin)
• Discharge regimen: similar to admission regimen unless poor outPt cntl or strong
reason for .Arrange early insulin and glucometer teaching, prompt outPt follow-up.
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
Precipitants (the Is)
• Insulin defic. (ie, failure to take enough insulin); Iatrogenesis (glucocorticoids)
• Infection (pneumonia, UTI) or Inflammation (pancreatitis, cholecystitis)
• Ischemia or Infarction (myocardial, cerebral, gut); Intoxication (alcohol, drugs)
Pathophysiology
• Occurs in T1D (and in ketosis-prone T2D); c glucagon and T insulin
• Hyperglycemia due to: c gluconeogenesis, c glycogenolysis, T glucose uptake into cells
• Ketosis due to: insulin deficiency S mobilization and oxidation of fatty acids,
c substrate for ketogenesis, c ketogenic state of the liver, T ketone clearance
Clinical manifestations (Diabetes Care 2003;26:S109)
• Polyuria, polydipsia, & dehydration S c HR, HoTN, dry mucous membranes, T skin turgor 
• Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (either due to intra-abdominal process or DKA), ileus
• Kussmaul’s respirations (deep) to compensate for metabolic acidosis with odor of acetone
•  MS S somnolence, stupor, coma; mortality 1% even at tertiary care centers
Diagnostic studies
• c anion gap metabolic acidosis: can later develop nonanion gap acidosis due to
urinary loss of ketones (HCO3 equivalents) and fluid resuscitation with chloride
• Ketosis:  urine and serum ketones (acetoacetate measured by nitroprusside, but
predominant ketone is -OH-butyrate; urine ketones may be  in fasting normal Pts)
• c serum glc; c BUN & Cr (dehydration 	 artifact due to ketones interfering w/ some assays)
• Pseudohyponatremia: corrected Na  measured Na  [2.4  (measured glc –100)/100]
• T or c K (but even if serum K is elevated, usually total body K depleted); T total body phos
• Leukocytosis, c amylase (even if no pancreatitis)

• Aggressive hydration: initially NS, then 1/2 NS, average fluid loss up to 8–10 L
• Insulin (eg, 10 U IV followed by 0.05–0.1 U/kg/h)
HYPOGLYCEMIA
Etiologies in diabetics
• Excess insulin, oral hypoglycemics, missed meals, renal failure (T insulin & SU clearance)
• -blockers can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia
Etiologies in nondiabetics
• c insulin: exogenous insulin, sulfonylureas, insulinoma, anti–insulin antibodies
• T glucose production: hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, glucagon deficiency,
hepatic failure, renal failure, CHF, alcoholism, sepsis
• c IGF-II: non–islet tumor
• Postprandial, esp. postgastrectomy or gastric bypass: excessive response to glc load
• Low glc w/o sx can be normal
Clinical manifestations (glucose 55 mg/dL)
• CNS: headache, visual s,  MS, weakness, seizure, LOC (neuroglycopenic sx)
• Autonomic: diaphoresis, palpitations, tremor (adrenergic sx)
Evaluation in nondiabetics (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2009;94:709)
• If clinically ill: take measures to avoid recurrent hypoglycemia; ✓BUN, Cr, LFTs,TFTs;
IGF-I/IGF-II ratio when appropriate
• If otherwise healthy: 72-h fast w/ monitored blood glc; stop for neuroglycopenic sx
• At time of hypoglycemia: insulin, C peptide (c w/ insulinoma and sulfonylureas, T w/
exogenous insulin), -OH-butyrate, sulfonylurea levels
• At end of fast, give 1 mg glucagon IV and measure response of plasma glc before feeding
Treatment
• Glucose tablets, paste, fruit juice are first-line Rx for Pts who can take POs
• If IV access available, give 25–50 g of D50 (50% dextrose)
• If no IV, can give glucagon 0.5–1 mg IM or SC (side effect: N/V)

ARTHRITIS—OVERVIEW
Approach to patient with joint pain
• Hx: distinguish joint vs. soft tissue pain, inflammatory vs. noninflammatory pain
Features suggestive of inflammatory pain: swelling in specific joint (w/o h/o trauma),
persistence over days to weeks, morning stiffness, improvement of pain and stiffness
w/ motion & exercise, improvement w/ NSAIDs or steroids
• Physical exam (see later): localize complaint and determine if there are objective
signs of inflammation (arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis) or noninflammatory pain
(arthralgia, myofascial pain)
• Osteoarthritis can p/w bony enlargement or crepitus, w/ or w/o noninflammatory
effusion

• Environmental factors: smoking, silica dust exposure
• c risk w/ shared epitope & smoke b/c gene–environment interaction (Ann Rheum Dis 2010;69:70)
• Prevalence  1% of adults; female:male  3:1; onset 35–50 y; worldwide
Clinical manifestations (Lancet 2001;358:903)
• Pain, swelling, and impaired function of joints (typically PIPs, MCPs, wrists, knees,
ankles, MTPs, and cervical spine) with morning stiffness for 1 h
• Polyarticular in 75% (60% small joints, 30% large joints, 10% both), monoarticular in
25% (knee, shoulder, wrist)
• Joint immobilization, muscle shortening, bone & cartilage destruction, joint deformities:
ulnar deviation, swan neck (MCP flexion, PIP hyperextension, DIP flexion),
boutonnière (PIP flexion, DIP hyperextension), cock-up deformities (toes)
• C1–C2 instability S myelopathy, ∴✓C-spine flex/ext films prior to elective intubation
• Rheumatoid nodules (20–30%; usually in sero- Pts): SC nodules on extensor 
surfaces along tendon sheaths and in bursae; also occur in lung, heart, and sclera
• Constitutional symptoms: fever, weight loss, malaise
• Ocular: scleritis, episcleritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (associated Sjögren’s)
• Pulmonary (20% of the time precedes joint manifestations)
ILD: COP, fibrosis, nodules, Caplan’s syndrome (pneumoconiosis  rheumatoid nodules)
pleural disease: pleuritis, pleural effusions (classically low glucose)
pulmonary hypertension
airway disease: obstruction (cricoarytenoid arthritis), bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis
• Cardiac: pericarditis (effusion in 13 of sero-), myocarditis, nodules can cause valvular
and/or conduction disease. Associated with c risk of cardiovascular death com-
pared with that of general population (Rheum 2009;48:1309).
• Heme: anemia of chronic inflammation, leukemia, lymphoma
• Vascular: small nail fold infarcts, palpable purpura, leukocytoclastic vasculitis
• Renal: glomerulonephritis (membranous, mesganigal, MPGN); nephrotic syndrome
due to AA amyloidosis; Rx-induced, including NSAIDs (AIN, membranous GN),

ulinemia, 5% of healthy population
• ACPA (anti–citrullinated peptide Ab) or anti-CCP (Ab to cyclic citrullinated peptide): simi-
lar Se (80%), more Sp (90%) than RF particularly for early RA (Arth Rheum 2009;61:1472)

• Rare in premenopausal women (estrogens promote renal urate excretion)
• Risk factors: c serum uric acid (UA) related to metabolic syndrome; HTN; chronic kid-
ney disease; c intake of meat, seafood, and EtOH (Lancet 2004;363:1277; NEJM 2004;350:1093)

CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE (CPPD)
DEPOSITION DISEASE
Definition
• Deposition of CPPD crystals w/in tendons, ligaments, articular capsules, synovium,
cartilage
• Acute inflammation due to CPPD crystals in a joint is termed pseudogout
• Chondrocalcinosis: calcification of cartilage visible on radiographs, resulting from
CPPD deposition in articular cartilage, fibrocartilage, or menisci
Epidemiology
• More common in elderly: 20% over age 60 y have knee chondrocalcinosis in autopsy studies
Etiologies
• Most cases idiopathic, but consider search for underlying cause, especially in the young
• Metabolic: the 3 Hs: hemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism;
diabetes, hypomagnesemia, alkaline phosphatase deficiency, familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia, gout, Gitelman’s syndrome, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets
• Joint trauma (incl. previous surgery); joint injections with hyaluronate can precipitate attacks
• Familial chondrocalcinosis (autosomal dominant disorder)
Pathogenesis
• c synovial & joint fluid levels of inorganic pyrophosphate produced by articular chon-
drocytes from ATP hydrolysis in response to various insults or inherited defects
favors CPPD crystallogenesis and deposition in the cartilage matrix
• Crystals activate cryopyrin inflammasome S IL-1	 S inflammation (Nature 2006;440:237) 
Clinical manifestations
• Pseudogout: acute mono- or asymmetric oligoarticular arthritis, indistinguishable from
gout except through synovial fluid exam for crystals
location: knees, wrists, and MCP joints
precipitants: surgery, trauma, or severe illness
• “Pseudo-RA”: chronic polyarticular arthritis with morning stiffness;  RF
• Premature OA: destruction of articular cartilage and bony overgrowths S degen. of joints
Diagnostic studies
• Arthrocentesis
take care not to tap through an infected area thus introducing infxn into joint space
polarized microscopy S rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals
(yellow perpendicular and blue parallel to axis marked on polarizer)
WBC 2000–100,000/mm3, 50% polys
infection can coexist with acute attacks, ∴always check Gram stain and culture
• Screen for associated metabolic diseases when dx a new case: ✓Ca, Mg,TSH, Fe, glc, UA
• Radiographs: though not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of CPPD disease,
chondrocalcinosis appears as punctate and linear densities in articular cartilage, menisci,
triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist, small joints of fingers, and symphysis pubis
Treatment
• Acute therapy for pseudogout: same as for gout, though colchicine not as effective
• Chronic therapy: treat predisposing disease
• Low-dose daily colchicine may be effective prophylaxis in some Pts

SERONEGATIVE SPONDYLOARTHRITIS
GENERAL
Definition (Annals 2002;136:896)
• A spectrum of systemic inflammatory arthritides w/ predilection for the spine,
entheses, sacroiliac, and peripheral joints; affects 0.5–2% of population
• 5 subtypes: ankylosing spondylitis, reactive, psoriatic, IBD-associated, and
undifferentiated (does not meet criteria for other subtypes, wide clinical spectrum)
• Notable for absence of rheumatoid factor or autoantibodies;  c ESR
• Synovial fluid of affected joints shows an inflammatory, nonseptic picture
Pathogenesis (Semin Arthritis Rheum 2008;38:83)
• c prevalence of HLA-B27:  in 50–90% of Pts, but common in general pop. (6–8%) 
• HLA-B27 accounts for 30% of attributable genetic risk, but not used for dx
• Other gene associations: IL23R (26% of attributable risk) and ARTS1 (9%)
• Environmental factors likely critical for disease, esp. reactive arthritis (eg, infection)
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
Epidemiology
• Onset in teens or mid-20s; onset after age 40 y very unusual; male:female ratio 
3:1; HLA-B27  in 90%
Clinical manifestations
• Gradual onset of chronic, intermittent bouts of lower back pain and stiffness
• Morning stiffness that improves with hot shower and exercise
• Progressive limitation of motion in cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spine over time
Severity of lumbar flexion deformity assessed by  modified Wright-Schober
test (4 cm c in distance between a point at lumbosacral jxn and another point
10 cm above, when going from standing to maximum forward flexion)
T-spine mobility (extension) and kyphosis severity measured by occiput-to-wall distance 
• Enthesitis: inflammation at site of tendon/ligament insertion into bone, eg,Achilles
tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, rigidity of spine (bamboo spine by x-ray) 
• Arthritis in peripheral joints can occur, eg, hips, shoulders, knees
• Acute anterior uveitis (25–40% at some time during disease): presents with unilateral 
blurred vision, lacrimation, and photophobia
• Cardiovascular disease (5%): ascending aortitis,AI, conduction system abnormalities
• Neurologic complications: spinal fractures, C1/2 subluxation, or cauda equina syndrome
Imaging studies
• Radiographs of spine to assess progression of disease:
Sacroiliac joint disease with erosions and sclerosis
Calcification of spinal ligaments with bridging syndesmophytes (“bamboo spine”)
Squaring and generalized demineralization of vertebral bodies,“shiny corners”
• MRI spine to assess inflammation in sacroiliac joint, esp. early in disease course
Treatment (Lancet 2007;369:1379; Curr Opin Rheumatol 2009;21:324)
• Supportive: physical therapy, NSAIDs, steroid injection
• Anti-TNF shown to improve symptoms and function (Ann Rheum Dis 2006;65:423)
• MTX: somewhat effective for peripheral arthritis, but little or no effect on spinal sx;
SAS may provide benefit in Pts w/o peripheral arthritis (Ann Rheum Dis 2006;65:1147)
REACTIVE ARTHRITIS
Epidemiology
• Ages 20–40 y; male:female ratio  5:1; more common in Caucasians

• Bacteria associated with disease
GU: Chlamydia and Ureaplasma urealyticum
GI: Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, C. difficile
Clinical presentation
• Originally described as a triad of seronegative arthritis, nongonococcal
urethritis, and noninfectious conjunctivitis (Reiter’s syndrome)
• Arthritis: 10–30 d post–inciting infection S mild constitutional sx, low back pain, asym-
metric, mono- or oligoarticular arthritis of primarily large joints (knees, ankles, feet),
enthesopathy, and sacroiliitis. Can develop sausage digits (dactylitis) of extremities.

--- Fim da Página 211 ---

• Urethritis/cervicitis: usually Chlamydia infection preceding arthritis, but also can see
sterile urethritis in postdysenteric reactive arthritis
• Conjunctivitis: noninfectious, unilateral or bilateral and  uveitis, iritis, and keratitis

palms, trunk, scalp
stomatitis and superficial oral ulcers
• GI: diarrhea and abdominal pain either w/ or w/o infectious agent
• CV:AI from inflammation and scarring of aorta and valve; conduction defects
Radiographs
• Early: soft tissue swelling and effusions around affected joints
• Late: asymmetric proliferation of bone at site of inflammation
• Asymmetric sacroiliitis in 70%
Diagnostic studies
• PCR of urine or genital swab for Chlamydia, stool cultures, C. difficile toxin, etc., but 
studies do not rule out
Treatment and prognosis
• NSAIDs, steroid injection for mono- or oligoarthritis, SAS if inflammation persists
• Antibiotics if evidence of active or antecedent infection, as cx may be 
• Arthritis may persist for months to years, and recurrences are common
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
Epidemiology
• Seen in 20–30% of Pts w/ psoriasis (and not necessarily those with severe skin disease)
• Arthritis may precede onset of skin disease, even by years; a/w nail changes
• 20–40% of Pts with psoriatic arthritis have spinal or sacroiliac involvement
•  Men and women are affected equally and most Pts in 30s and 40s
Clinical manifestations
• Several clinical patterns of arthritis:
monoarticular/oligoarticular (eg, large joint, DIP joint, dactylitic digit): most
common initial manifestation
polyarthritis (small joints of the hands and feet, wrists, ankles, knees, elbows):
indistinguishable from RA, but often asymmetric
arthritis mutilans: severe destructive arthritis with bone resorption, esp. hands
axial disease: similar to ankylosing spondylitis  peripheral arthritis
• Enthesopathies, tendinitis
• Fingernails: pitting, transverse depressions, onycholysis, subungal hyperkeratosis
• Eye inflammation (30%): conjunctivitis, iritis, episcleritis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca
• Psoriatic skin lesions
Radiographs
• “Pencil-in-cup” deformity seen at DIP joints, erosive changes
• Spinal involvement, sacroiliitis
Treatment
• Symptom control: NSAIDs; intra-articular glucocorticoid injections

ENTEROPATHIC (IBD-ASSOCIATED)
Epidemiology
• Seen in 20% of Pts w/ IBD; more frequently seen in Crohn’s than UC
Clinical manifestations

onset, large joints, course parallels GI disease
• Spondylitis: associated more strongly with HLA-B27, course does not parallel GI disease
• Sacroiliitis
• Erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum ( neutrophilic dermatosis S painful ulcers w/
violaceous border; Ddx incl. idiopathic, IBD, RA, myelogenous leukemia), anterior uveitis

• CT and MRI useful especially for suspected hip infection or epidural abscess
Definitive treatment (for nonprosthetic joints)
• Antibiotics (as earlier)
• Surgical drainage/lavage indicated in many cases, especially for larger joints
• Prognosis: 10–50% mortality depending on virulence of organism, time to Rx, host

OLECRANON AND PREPATELLAR BURSITIS
Epidemiology and risk factors (Infect Dis North Am 2005;19:991)
• 150 bursae in the body; two most commonly infected are olecranon and prepatellar
• Most commonly due to direct trauma, percutaneous inoculation, or contiguous
spread from adjacent infection (eg, cellulitis)
• Other risk factors: recurrent noninfectious inflammation (eg, gout, RA, CPPD), diabetes
• S. aureus (80%) most common, followed by streptococci
Diagnosis
• Physical exam: discrete bursal swelling, erythema, maximal tenderness at center of
bursa with preserved joint range of motion
• Aspirate bursa if concern for infxn, ✓cell count, gram stain, bacterial cx, crystals
WBC 20,000 with poly predominance suspicious for bacterial infection, but
lower counts common (crystals do not rule out septic bursitis!)
• Assess for adjacent joint effusion, which can also be septic
• Take care not to tap through infected skin thus introducing infxn into bursa
Initial therapy
• Prompt empiric coverage for staphylococci and streptococci: cefazolin or oxacillin,

• Autoantibody testing is directed by clinical findings, as autoantibodies themselves do
not define a particular connective tissue disease
• Overlap syndromes encompassing more than one connective tissue disorder may be
reflected serologically by the presence of multiple autoantibodies
see “Systemic Lupus Erythematosus” and “Rheumatoid Arthritis” for those diseases
SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS AND SCLERODERMA DISORDERS
Definition and epidemiology
• Scleroderma refers to the presence of tight, thickened skin
• Localized scleroderma  morphea (plaques of fibrotic skin), linear (fibrotic bands),
“en coup de saber” (linear scleroderma on one side of scalp and forehead ≈saber scar)
• Systemic sclerosis (SSc)  scleroderma  internal organ involvement. Subgroups:
SSc w/ limited cutaneous disease (hands, arms, face): CREST syndrome, pulm HTN;
renal and cardiac manifestations rare
SSc w/ diffuse cutaneous disease (incl. proximal extremities & trunk): rapidly pro-
gressing disorder affecting skin, one or more internal organs
SSc sine scleroderma (visceral disease without skin involvement, rare)
• Peak onset of SSc between ages 30–50; more common in women than men
• 1–2/100,000 annual incidence of systemic disease in the U.S.
• Pathogenesis: immune damage to endothelial cells and reactive O2 species produc-
tion S persistent oxidative stress S perivascular inflammation S fibroblast activa-
tion and fibrosis. Cytokines, growth factors, and autoantibodies (against PDGF
receptor, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts) all contribute (NEJM 2009;360:1989).
Classification criteria (1 major or 2 minor; 97% Se, 98% Sp; Arth Rheum 1980;23:581)
• Major: skin findings extend proximal to MCP or MTP joints
• Minor: sclerodactyly (skin findings limited to the fingers)
digital pitting scars from loss of substance on the finger pad
bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis
• Other causes of thickened skin: diabetes (scleredema ≠scleroderma), hypothyroidism,
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, eosinophilic fasciitis, amyloidosis, GVHD, drug or toxin
Diagnostic studies
• Autoantibodies
 anti-Scl-70 (anti-topoisomerase 1): 40% of diffuse, 15% of limited
 anti-centromere: 60–80% of limited, 5% of diffuse
 ANA (90%),  RF (30%)
• If renal involvement S c BUN and Cr, proteinuria
• If pulmonary involvement S interstitial pattern on CXR/chest CT, restriction and/or
T DLCO on PFTs; PHT revealed by echocardiography
• Skin bx not routine, but helpful to assess other possible causes for skin thickening

Treatment (organ-based approach)
• Pulmonary
fibrosis: cyclophosphamide (NEJM 2006;354:2653), steroids
PAH: pulmonary vasodilators (see “Pulmonary Hypertension”)
• Renal: monitor BP monthly, intervene early to avoid HTN crisis; dipstick for protein
ACE inhibitors (not ARB) for HTN crisis (poor prognosis w/ 50% mortality)
• GI: PPI and/or H2-blockers for GERD; antibiotics for malabsorption
hypomotility: metoclopramide or erythromycin; nonoperative Rx of pseudoobstruction
• Cardiac: NSAIDs or steroids for pericarditis
• Arthritis: acetaminophen, NSAIDs, PT
• Myositis: MTX, AZA, steroids
• Skin: PUVA for morphea. For pruritis: emollients, topical or oral steroids (use w/ cau-
tion, can precip HTN renal crisis, Arthritis Rheum 1998;41:1613). Immunosuppressives
offer only minimal to modest benefit for skin fibrosis.

dementia or psychiatric disorders; head trauma; meds, drug or alcohol use
• General physical examination: evaluate for asterixis, signs of trauma, stigmata of
liver disease, embolic phenomena, signs of drug use, nuchal rigidity (may be present
in meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, but do not test if question of
trauma/cervical spine fracture)
• Neurologic examination (if possible, off sedatives/paralytics)

ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY
Prevalence
• Pts w/ at least 5 min of cerebral hypoxia at risk
• 1.5 million cardiac arrests per year in U.S.; 30% survive, but only 10–20% return to
independence
Initial evaluation
• Neuro exam: focus on coma exam S cranial nerves, motor response to pain
• Imaging: usually not informative w/in first day after arrest, but should be done prior
to initiating hypothermia if patient found down or witnessed to hit head

Induced hypothermia (NEJM 2002;346:549, 559)
• Indications: comatose w/in 6 h following cardiac arrest (not isolated resp. arrest).
Fully studied only in VT/VF, but acceptable to perform after asystole or PEA arrest.
• Contraindications: active bleeding, including cerebral; known sepsis; recent surgery or
trauma (relative); CV instability; clear improvement in neurologic exam (purposeful
movements, vocalizations)
• Method: target temperature 32–34C  24 h (from time of initiation of cooling)
cold saline infusions; ice packs to the head, neck, and torso; cooling blankets
may use cooling vest or endovascular catheter if available
• Complications
cardiac dysrhythmias (bradycardia most common): if significant dysrhythmia or
hemodynamic instability, d/c cooling and actively rewarm patient (this is only cir-
cumstance in which active rewarming should be performed; o/w rewarm no
faster than 0.5C per h)
coagulopathy: Pts can receive fibrinolytics, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, etc., and still
undergo cooling. ✓PT and PTT.
infection: ✓surveillance blood cultures during cooling
hyperglycemia
hypokalemia during cooling, hyperkalemia w/ rewarming; keep K 4–5 mEq/L
Ongoing evaluation
• Neuro exam: daily focus on coma exam, cranial nerves, GCS score. Pt needs to be
off sedation for adequate time to evaluate (depends on doses used, duration of
Rx, metabolic processes in the individual Pt).
• Labs: daily CBC, PT/PTT, electrolytes. Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) on day 1–3
• Imaging: noncontrast CT 24 h after arrest; if unrevealing, MRI around day 3–5
• EEG: should be performed in any Pt w/ seizures or myoclonus (to r/o status epilepti-
cus); should be considered in all unresponsive Pts (to r/o nonconvulsive seizures)
• Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP): helpful for prediction of poor outcome if
absent cortical responses bilaterally; should not be performed earlier than 48 h
after arrest (72 h if cooled)
Prognosis (Neuro 2006;67:203; NEJM 2009;361:605)
• Uniformly poor prognosis can be predicted at 72 h only in Pts who have absent
pupillary and corneal reflexes, and no motor response to pain; also with absent
SSEPs at 48 h
• Otherwise, requires multifactorial approach, considering neuro exam, age and
comorbid diseases, and ancillary data (serum NSE, neuroimaging, EEG, SSEP)
• When in doubt, err on the side of giving more time (especially in younger Pts and
induced hypothermia Pts)

SEIZURES
Definitions (NEJM 2003;349:1257)
• Seizure  abnormal, paroxysmal, excessive discharge of CNS neurons; occurs in
5–10% of the population; clinical manifestations can range from dramatic to subtle
• Epilepsy  recurrent seizures due to an underlying cause; 0.5–1.0% of population
• Generalized seizures (involves brain diffusely)
Tonic-clonic (grand mal): tonic phase (10–20 sec) with contraction of muscles (caus-
ing expiratory moan, cyanosis, pooling of secretions, tongue biting) S clonic
phase (30 sec) with intermittent relaxing and tensing of muscles
Absence (petit mal): transient lapse of consciousness w/o loss of postural tone
Myoclonic (infantile spasms & juvenile myoclonic epilepsy): sudden, brief contraction
• Partial or focal seizures (involves discrete areas, implies a focal, structural lesion)
Simple: without impairment of consciousness; may be motor, sensory, or autonomic
Complex: with impairment of consciousness  automatisms
Partial with secondary generalization: starts focal, becomes diffuse

• Nonepileptic seizure (NES, aka “psychogenic”): may see side-to-side head turning,
asymmetric large-amplitude limb movements, diffuse twitching w/o LOC, and crying
or talking during event
• Other: metabolic disorders (eg, alcoholic blackouts, hypoglycemia); migraines; TIAs;
narcolepsy; nonepileptic myoclonus; tics; asterixis
Etiologies
• Alcohol withdrawal, illicit drugs, meds (eg, -lactams, bupropion, tramadol, metro-
nidazole, meperidine, CsA, antidep., clozapine can lower seizure threshold)
• Brain tumor or penetrating trauma
• Cerebrovascular disease, including subdural hematomas, hypertensive encephalopathy
• Degenerative disorders of the CNS (eg, Alzheimer’s)
• Electrolyte (hyponatremia) & other metabolic (eg, uremia, liver failure, hypoglycemia)
Clinical manifestations
• Aura (sec to mins): premonition consisting of abnormal smells/tastes, unusual behav-
ior, oral or appendicular automatisms
• Ictal period (sec to mins): tonic and/or clonic movements of head, eyes, trunk, or extrem.
• Postictal period (mins to h): slowly resolving period of confusion, disorientation,
and lethargy. May be accompanied by focal neurologic deficits (Todd’s paralysis).
• Status epilepticus: continuous tonic-clonic seizure 30 min, or repeated seizures
such that there is no resolution of postictal periods. Complications include neu-
ronal death, rhabdomyolysis, and lactic acidosis.
• Nonconvulsive status epilepticus alteration of awareness (ranging from confu-
sion to coma) w/o motor manifestations. Dx with EEG.
Clinical evaluation
• Seizure: patient usually w/o recollection, must talk to witnesses
unusual behavior before seizure (ie, an aura)
type & pattern of abnl movements, incl. head turning & eye deviation (gaze prefer-
ence usually away from seizure focus)
loss of responsiveness
• HPI: recent illnesses/fevers, head trauma, sleep deprivation, medication compliance
• PMH: prior seizures or  FHx, prior meningitis/encephalitis, prior stroke or head trauma
• Medications, alcohol, and illicit drug use
• General physical exam should include the skin, looking for neuroectodermal disorders
(eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) that are a/w seizures
• Neurologic exam should look for focal abnormalities S underlying structural abnormality
Diagnostic studies
• Laboratory: full electrolytes, BUN, Cr, glc, LFTs, tox screen, medication levels
• EEG: if frequent, can capture repetitive rhythmic activity (nb, generalized seizures will
always have abnl EEG; partial may not); eval for interictal epileptiform activity

abnormality or an idiopathic seizure plus (i) status epilepticus on presentation, (ii)
focal neurologic exam, (iii) postictal Todd’s paralysis, or (iv) abnormal EEG
• For Pts w/ infrequent seizures, early (vs. delayed) intervention w/ AED c time to seizure
recurrence, but has no effect on long-term seizure-free status (Lancet 2005;365:2007)
• AED choice dependent on type of seizure, side effects, cost, and drug interactions
• Introduce gradually, monitor carefully
• May consider withdrawal if seizure-free (typically for at least 1 y) and normal EEG

Status epilepticus (consult neurology)
• Place Pt in semiprone position to T risk of aspiration
• Oral airway or, if prolonged, endotracheal intubation
• IV access, start normal saline infusion
• STAT labs including glc, Na, Ca, serum & urine toxicology screen, anticonvulsant levels
• Thiamine (100 mg IV) prior to dextrose to prevent exacerb. of Wernicke’s encephalopathy
• Dextrose (50 g IV push)
Treatment of Status Epilepticus
(Proceed to next step if seizures continue)
Step

1
Lorazepam or
0.1 mg/kg at 2 mg/min
Successive 2–4 mg IV pushes
Diazepam
0.2 mg/kg at 5 mg/min
Successive 5–10 mg IV pushes
Lorazepam marginally slower onset of action (3 vs. 2 min) but at least as efficacious
(success 65%) & longer duration of effect (12–24 h vs. 15–30 min)

ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL
Pathophysiology
• Alcohol is CNS depressant
• Chronic use S insensitivity to inhibitory neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA)
• Abrupt alcohol cessation S CNS overactivity
Clinical manifestations
• Minor withdrawal sx (6–48 h after last drink): mild anxiety, tremulousness, HA
• Withdrawal seizures: typically w/in 48 h after last drink; if unRx’d, 1⁄3 S delirium tremens
• Alcoholic hallucinosis: isolated hallucinations (typically visual) 12–48 h after last drink
• Delirium tremens (DT): disorientation, agitation, hallucinations, c HR & BP, fever,
diaphoresis; begins 48–96 h after last drink, lasts 5–7 d
• Need to consider other dx: CNS infxn, CNS bleed, drug O/D, acute liver failure, GIB
Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment scale for alcohol (CIWA-Ar)

Treatment (NEJM 2003;348:1786)
• Benzodiazepines (BDZ)
Drug: diazepam (long-acting w/ active metab; T risk of recurrent withdrawal), lorazepam
(short half-life), chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam (no active metabs; good if cirrhosis)
Route: start IV, transition to PO
Dosing: typically start w/ diazepam 10–15 mg IV q10–15 min (or lorazepam 2–4 mg IV
q15–20 min) until appropriate sedation achieved, then titrate to CIWA-Ar scale, eval-
uating q1h until score 8  8h, then q2h  8h, and if stable then q4h (JAMA 1994;272:519)
• If refractory to BDZ prn, consider BDZ gtt, phenobarbital or propofol (& intubation)
• Do not give haloperidol (T seizure threshold) or B / central 2-agonists (mask sx)
• Mechanical restraints as needed until chemical sedation achieved
• Volume resuscitation as needed; thiamine then glc to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy
(ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, short-term memory loss); replete K, Mg, PO4
• Prophylaxis: if min sx or asx (ie, CIWA score 8) but prolonged heavy EtOH con-
sumption or h/o withdrawal seizures or DTs S chlordiazepoxide 25–100 mg
(based on severity of EtOH use) q6h  24h, then 25–50 mg q6h  2d

Transient ischemia attacks (TIAs) are sudden neurologic deficits caused by cerebral
ischemia w/o evidence of infarction on imaging; sx typically resolve w/in 24 h (usually w/in 1 h);
a harbinger of stroke.
Ddx: seizure, migraine, syncope, hypoglycemia, anxiety
Physical examination
• General including rhythm, murmurs, carotid & subclavian bruits, signs of peripheral emboli
• Neurologic including NIH stroke scale (NIHSS)
Diagnostic studies
• Laboratory: electrolytes, Cr, glc, CBC, PT, PTT, LFTs, ESR, tox screen, BCx (if suspicion for
endocarditis); once stable, lipids, HbA1c,TSH, homocysteine, Lp(a), hypercoag w/u (if
65 y or in those w/ cryptogenic strokes; ideally drawn before anticoagulation initiated)
• ECG
• Urgent CT is usually the initial imaging study because of its rapidity and availability
first, noncontrast CT to r/o hemorrhage (Se for ischemic 	s is 20% w/in 12 h)
then, CT angio/perfusion to evaluate cerebrovascular patency and areas of reversible
ischemia (if intra-arterial/catheter-based interventions are being considered)
• MRI offers superior imaging but may not identify acute hemorrhage (although data sug-
gest may be equivalent; JAMA 2004;292:1823) and may be falsely  for small brainstem
strokes w/in 1st 3 h; should be delayed if Pt is unstable or will delay therapy
• Carotid Doppler U/S, transcranial Doppler (TCD)
• Holter monitoring to assess for paroxysmal AF
• Echocardiography w/ bubble study to r/o PFO or atrial septal aneurysm (confer 4
c risk of stroke; NEJM 2001;345:1740), cardiac thrombus, valvular vegetations
Treatment of TIA (NEJM 2002;347:1687)
• Immediate evaluation and treatment as clinically indicated (Lancet 2007;370:1432)
• Consider heparin IV S warfarin if: known or presumptive cardioembolic TIAs or if
bridging to mechanical intervention (CEA, stenting) for large vessel atherothrombotic dis.
• Antiplatelet therapy with ASA, clopidogrel, or ASA 
 dipyridamole
• Carotid revascularization if sx 70% ipsilateral stenosis (see later)
Risk of progression of TIA to stroke (Lancet 2007;369:283)
• ABCD2: Age 60 y (
1); BP 140/90 (
1); Clin. features: unilateral weakness (
2), speech
impairment w/o weakness (
1); Duration 60 (
2) or 10–59 min (
1); Diabetes (
1)
• Risk of stroke at 2 d: low risk (0–3)  1.0%; moderate (4–5)  4.1%; high (6–7)  8.1%
• Risk of progression higher for TIAs due to large artery/lacunar dis. (vs. cardioembolic)

Treatment of ischemic stroke (NEJM 2008;359:1317; Lancet 2010;375:1695)
• Thrombolysis (IV): 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg), w/ 10% as bolus over 1 min, rest over 1 h
consider if onset w/in 4.5 h, large deficit, ∅hemorrhage, and ∅contraindication to lysis.
For Pts Rx’d w/in 3 h, 12% absolute c in excellent functional outcome, 5.8%
absolute c ICH, trend toward 4% absolute T mortality (NEJM 1995;333:1381)
• Intra-arterial therapy with thrombolysis (JAMA 1999;282:2003) or catheter-based tech-
niques promising (66% rate of recanalization) but still experimental;
currently reserved for occlusion of a major vessel (ICA, MCA, basilar)
• Anticoag w/ UFH of no proven benefit w/ c risk of hemorrhagic transformation 
consider infusion w/o bolus if Pt not thrombolysed and having progressive sx
long-term warfarin if embolic stroke; no role in nonembolic stroke (NEJM 2001;345:1444)
• Antiplatelet therapy
ASA T death & recurrent stroke (Stroke 2000;31:1240) and is superior to warfarin
alone (NEJM 2005;352:1305)
dipyridamole  ASA superior to ASA alone (Lancet 2006;367:1665)
clopidogrel  ASA not more effective than ASA alone and c bleeding (Lancet 2004;364:331)
dipyridamole  ASA ≈clopidogrel alone in risk of recurrent stroke, and T bleeding
w/ clopidogrel, but study limited by preponderance of small-vessel subtype (NEJM
2008;359:1238)
• BP should not be lowered acutely unless severe (SBP 200) or evidence of MI or CHF
if considering thrombolysis, then lower to 180/110 with nitrates or labetalol
• DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin more efficacious than UFH (Lancet 2007;369:1347)
• Cerebral edema peaks at 3–4 d poststroke S c ICP requiring elevated head of bed
30; intubation & hyperventilation to PaCO2 30 (transient benefit);

sx stenosis 70% (? 50–69% if male, age 75 y, or recent sx) S 65% T
stroke (NEJM 1991;325:445; Lancet 2004;363:915)
asx stenosis 70% & 75 y S 50% T stroke (Lancet 2004;363:1491)
• Superiority and even noninferiority of carotid stenting remains controversial (NEJM

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) (NEJM 2005;353:2361)
• Present in 27% of population; may be a/w stroke, but yearly risk 0.1% in healthy pop.
• Features a/w c risk of stroke: 4 mm separation, R S L shunting at rest, c septal mobility
• If PFO & stroke/TIA: no evidence to favor warfarin over ASA (Circ 2002;105:2625); con-
sider anticoagulation if Pt is at high risk or has DVT/PE; closure trials ongoing
HEMORRHAGIC (30%)
Etiologies
• Intracerebral (90%): HTN (brainstem/cerebellum, basal ganglia), AVM, amyloid
angiopathy (lobar), anticoagulation/thrombolysis, venous thrombosis, tumors
• Subarachnoid (SAH, 10%; Lancet 2007;369:306): ruptured aneurysm, trauma
Clinical manifestations
• Impairment in level of consciousness, vomiting  headache, may cause progressive focal
neurologic deficit depending on site of hemorrhage, nuchal rigidity if SAH present
Diagnostic studies
• CT or ? MRI (JAMA 2004;292:1823)
• Angiography (CT or conventional) to determine the source of bleeding (aneurysm, AVM)
• LP to ✓for xanthochromia if no evidence of hemorrhage on CT and suspicious for SAH
Treatment
• Reverse any coagulopathies
• Platelets: keep 100k; unclear if transfusions necessary for patients on ASA
• Recombinant activated factor VII is currently investigational, but may T hematoma
expansion and mortality at the expense of c risk of adverse thromboembolic events
(NEJM 2005;352:777)
• Strict BP control w/ goal SBP 140, unless risk for hypoperfusion b/c critical carotid sten.
• ICH: surgical decompression for large hemorrhage with clinical deterioration
• SAH: nimodipine to T risk of vasospasm, phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, endovascu-
lar (Lancet 2005;366:783) or surgical correction of aneurysm/AVM to prevent rebleeding
• Cerebral venous thrombosis: paradoxically, requires anticoagulation with IV heparin

• Spinal cord (myelopathy) / nerve root (radiculopathy):
Degenerative/traumatic: disc herniation, spondylosis, fracture
Neoplastic: lung, breast, prostate, multiple myeloma, lymphoma
Infectious (also see ID section): osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, zoster, Lyme, CMV, HIV
• Referred pain from visceral disease: (quality of pain can be important to distinguish)
GI: PUD, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer
GU: pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, uterine or ovarian cancer, salpingitis
Vascular: aortic dissection, leaking aortic aneurysm
Initial evaluation
• History: location, radiation, neurologic symptoms, infection, malignancy
• General physical examination: local tenderness, ROM, signs of infection or malignancy,
signs of radiculopathy (experienced as sharp/lancinating pain radiating into limb):
Spurling sign (radicular pain w/ downward force to extended & ipsilaterally rotated head)
straight leg raise (radicular pain at 30–70): ipsilateral: 95% Se, 40% Sp; crossed 
(contralateral leg raised): 25% Se, 90% Sp
• Neurologic examination: full motor (including sphincter tone), sensory (including
perineal region), and reflexes including anal (S4) and cremasteric (L2)
• Laboratory (depending on suspicion): CBC, ESR, Ca, PO4, A, CSF
• Neuroimaging: low yield if nonradiating pain, high false  rate (incidental spondylosis)
depending on suspicion: x-rays, CT or CT myelography, MRI, bone scan
• EMG/NCS may be useful to distinguish root/plexopathies from peripheral neuropathies
SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION
Clinical manifestations
• Acute: flaccid paraparesis and absent reflexes (“spinal shock”)
• Subacute-chronic: spastic paraparesis and hyperactive reflexes
• Posterior column dysfunction in legs (loss of vibratory sense or proprioception)
• Sensory loss below level of lesion
• Bilateral prominent Babinski responses  ankle clonus
Evaluation and treatment
• Empiric spine immobilization (collar, board) for all trauma patients
• STAT MRI (at and above clinical spinal level, pre- and postgadolinium) or CT myelogram
•  Emergent neurosurgical and/or neurology consultation
• Urgent radiation therapy  surgery for compression if due to metastatic disease
• High-dose steroids depending on cause:
Tumor: dexamethasone 10–100 mg IV  1 then 4–24 mg every 6 hr  
Trauma: controversial (may have slight benefit but c risk of infection, poor healing)
? methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV over 15 min then 45 min later: 5.4 mg/kg/h  23 h

FORMULAE
10-11
Warfarin-heparin overlap therapy
• Indications: when failure to anticoagulate carries c risk of morbidity or mortality
(eg, DVT/PE, intracardiac thrombus)
• Rationale: (1) Half-life of factor VII (3–6 h) is shorter than half-life of factor II (60–72 h);
∴warfarin can elevate PT before achieving a true antithrombotic state
(2) Protein C also has half-life less than that of factor II;
∴theoretical concern of hypercoagulable state before antithrombotic state
• Method: (1) Therapeutic PTT is achieved using heparin
(2) Warfarin therapy is initiated
(3) Heparin continued until INR therapeutic for 2 d and 4–5 d of warfarin
(roughly corresponds to 2 half-lives of factor II or a reduction to 25%)

3 COPD: with hyperlucent,overinflated lungs and flat diaphragms. (Radiology 101, 3rd ed, 2009.)
1 Normal PA CXR. The convex right cardiac border is formed by the right atrium
(straight arrows), and the curved arrows indicated the location of the superior vena cava.
The left cardiac and great vessels border what might be considered as four skiing moguls.
From cephalad to caudad, the moguls are the aortic arch, the main and left pulmonary arter-
ies, the left atrial appendage, and the left ventricle. (Radiology 101, 3rd ed, 2009.)
